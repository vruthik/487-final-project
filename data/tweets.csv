Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Always an honor to receive 's True Blue Award from  for defending faith, family and freedom. I'm proud to stand for these values and am thankful for so many folks in Arkansas and across the country who work so hard alongside us to protect and strengthen them. "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,I was pleased to spend time visiting with Marvell Academy seniors today to talk about my role as their US Senator and answer the great questions they had about policy and public service. It’s rewarding to see young Arkansans engaged in civics learning. 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,Americans want our border secured. They want to enforce the rule of law and protect our sovereignty. They want us to once again send the message that the U.S. border is closed to illegal immigration.The Biden administration still hasn’t gotten the message.  
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,On National  we share our gratitude for all those who served in Vietnam. I encourage all of us to thank the Vietnam vets in our lives who fought for our country and must always be remembered for their service and sacrifice. 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"""Climate"" appears over 100 times in USDA’s proposed budget – almost as often as the word ""agriculture."" And once again Pres. Biden has suggested raising taxes on hardworking family farmers and ranchers to pay for all this spending.The  is  repackaged. "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"My final  highlight is of world renowned engineer and Arkansan, Raye Montague. She created the first computer-generated rough draft of a U.S. naval ship, was the first female Program Manager of Ships in the U.S. Navy and was the recipient of countless awards. "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Arkansans continue to feel the consequences of Pres. Biden's inflation economy and energy policies: $3.82/gallon.When will he unleash American energy to help bring relief? We have the resources and technology to produce oil &amp; gas at home and provide affordable, reliable energy. "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"As home to more than 200k veterans, The Natural State benefits from their service in uniform and beyond. READ my latest column about honoring and recognizing their selflessness, heroism and sacrifice."
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"A great season that unfortunately had to come to an end, but we’re proud of the Hogs and enjoyed watching them give it their all every time they stepped on the court this season.  "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right, 🐗🐗🐗 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"They're calling the Hogs everywhere, including my staff in DC after the big  win Thursday. Coach  and his team have Arkansas fans fired up and believing we can keep dancing. Good luck tonight to this ELITE squad!   🐗 "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"I’m sad to learn of Sen. Hodges’ passing. I enjoyed getting to know him and admired the service he gave on behalf of his community, the state of Arkansas and our country. He leaves behind a distinguished legacy. We pray for the family and friends mourning and remembering him. "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,March is This rare autoimmune disease affects the central nervous system and is extremely taxing on those who have it and their loved ones. I encourage Arkansans and all Americans to learn more about MS and support those it affects. 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,On National  we commemorate all the brave warriors who have served their country and been recognized with this distinguished award. The incredible commitment shown by these heroes and their sacrifice deserves our honor and thanks.

Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,🚨The Senate passed two of my bills to modernize breast cancer screening policies and the delivery of lifesaving care for women 🇺🇸The Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas SERVICE Act + the MAMMO Act will help vulnerable  &amp; improve VA services⬇️⬇️⬇️
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Enjoyed visiting with Coleman Smith for Around The Table on KHOZ to talk about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, inflation, higher gas prices and more. I appreciated the opportunity to give Arkansans an update on these issues.Watch our discussion:  "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Pres. Biden went to war with American energy producers on Day 1 of his administration, and we're paying the (historic) price at the gas pump. The answer is staring us in the face: remove the obstacles and let U.S. energy companies and workers tap our own resources.via  "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"""The letter...echoes a March 8 request by U.S. Senator John Boozman of Arkansas""Proud to stand with  and leading agriculture organizations to ensure the stability of our food supply and support America's farmers and ranchers. "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,I'm LIVE on the Dave Elswick Show now. Tune in on the radio or listen live:  
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"The answer to soaring gas prices is staring us in the face: American energy independence. We've got the resources and technology to produce our own energy, in a more environmentally-sensitive way than other countries like Venezuela. It's time to unleash American energy. "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Military spouses make countless sacrifices supporting their husbands &amp; wives, and America’s defense. We can help reduce the burdens they face in the process of finding gainful employment by giving businesses an extra incentive to hire these unsung heroes."
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,We know Russia and its proxies want to wreak havoc on U.S. public and private infrastructure through cyberattacks. That's why my colleagues and I have been calling on the Biden administration to pull out all the stops and make sure we're prepared.➡️  
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"The actions of the Biden administration have certainly not been good for rural quality of life. Inflation, rising gas prices, supply chain disruptions, high input costs, tariffs and uncertainty surrounding global commodity markets are crushing farmers and rural communities. "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Higher gas prices and other challenges are putting rural America's vitality at stake.Monette, AR's mayor says climbing diesel fuel costs will hurt city budgets and operation of essential services.Misplaced priorities and misguided policies won't help."
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"This  I want to thank every Natural State farmer, rancher and forester whose hard work and long hours help feed, clothe and fuel the world while enriching and strengthening Arkansas's economy and communities. As  leader I'm thrilled to celebrate  "

Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,Happy Sunday and first day of spring! 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,March is  – a time to raise awareness for a disease that affects over 15% of adults in America. It's crucial we continue researching diagnosis and treatment for this chronic disease that has changed the lives of so many Americans. 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,Russia is justly cornered by extreme sanctions and could lash out against the U.S. through non-kinetic attacks. Joined a bipartisan group of senators seeking to ensure private &amp; public institutions are ready to defend against Russian or proxy cyberattacks.
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,Pleased my staff again has opportunities to attend more local events representing my office and demonstrating our strong partnerships with communities and organizations across Arkansas.Glad we're getting back to normal and looking forward to many more in the future.  
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,It was a pleasure to visit ’s campus in Fayetteville and talk with the staff about policy issues that affect their industry as well as provide an update on what’s happening in Washington and internationally. Appreciate the invitation and warm welcome. 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Congrats on a hard fought win,  — that’s what it takes to keep playing in March. We’re calling the Hogs tonight and all weekend!  🐗🐗🐗 "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,Go Hogs!  
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,I'm excited Arkansas and   continue to be leaders in animal vaccines research that strengthens our food supply. This announcement is great news on many fronts and we look forward to more good things to come. 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,Taxpayers shouldn't be forced to subsidize the destruction of human life. Planned Parenthood and other organizations prioritizing abortion have again been emboldened by the Biden admin.Our resolution would overturn its latest effort to send them funding.
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Happy  to all those celebrating, especially to our Irish-American friends and neighbors.As the traditional Irish blessing says, ""may you have all the happiness and luck that life can hold—and at the end of your rainbows may you find a pot of gold."" "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,Getting ready to join  on ⁦⁩. 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Great visit today with Cleburne Co. Sheriff Chris Brown and his wife Ali who were kind enough to ask how they can be praying for me, which I appreciate so much. Prayer works. There's nothing more meaningful a person can do for me. May God bless them and our great state.  "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,Arkansans know the pain at the gas pump didn't start 3 weeks ago. It's been increasing over the last 12 months.It's clearly a result of the Biden administration's war on U.S. energy producers. The time to reverse course and unleash American energy is now. 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"""On Sunday, one of Boozman’s constituents, the award-winning filmmaker and journalist Brent Renaud, was killed by Russian forces in Ukraine. 'This is hitting very personally. So Arkansans’s message to me is for us...to support the people of Ukraine.'”"
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,My full statement on 's address to Congress this morning. 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Julian from California recently wrote me asking for interesting facts about Arkansas for a class project.

Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Farmers in Arkansas and across the country are getting squeezed by higher input costs, especially for fertilizer which continues rising exponentially in price.I encourage the Biden administration to take specific steps to help bring them urgent relief ⤵️"
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,Wishing  a very happy 103rd birthday! 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"""Prices are going to continue going up...Inflation is not being dealt with properly in my opinion."" -David Jones (Texarkana, AR)We have to get inflation under control. It's decimating businesses and crippling our economy. This is a national emergency."
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Giving away the store to Iran won't result in a longer, stronger deal to block it from getting a nuclear weapon, constrain its ballistic missile program or end its support of terrorism. A weak agreement will meet stiff resistance from my colleagues and me."
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"My next  highlight is Bentonville native Louise Thaden. Thaden, an incredibly accomplished pilot, broke many records over her career and was a fearless aviator. She was inducted into the Arkansas Aviation Historical Society's Hall of Fame in 1980. "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,Russia's invasion of Ukraine is another reminder that we can't put ourselves at the mercy of other nations for essential products and commodities. READ my latest column about the need for U.S. energy and food supply independence.
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,Happy National . We proudly salute all the four-legged friends who have served alongside the men and women of our Armed Forces helping to protect and defend our country. 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Brent Renaud was an inspiring, talented storyteller who lost his life in the process of helping show the world the destruction &amp; human cost of Russia’s war on Ukraine. We couldn’t be more proud that he was an Arkansan. I’m praying for all those who are grieving his tragic death. "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right, is here and serves as a great reminder to stay healthy and up-to-date on the latest in prevention. Read more in the link below.  
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"It was great to join  Saturday this morning and talk about immigration, especially the contrast between the policies we had under Pres. Trump, that were so effective, versus the chaos and crisis we have at the border and in the immigration system today. "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"This story about an Arkansan being reunited with a bomber jacket that once belonged to her father – a WWII and Korea veteran – is a reminder of how special the Greatest Generation was not just to our country, but to their own families and loved ones."
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,Grateful for Wally West's bravery and dedication to protect others when he risked his own safety to neutralize an active shooter. He's deserving of this special recognition. 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,Let's Go HOGS!  🐗 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Enjoyed sitting down with leaders from the Army Corps of Engineers' Vicksburg and Memphis Districts, Mississippi Valley Division &amp; the St. Francis Levee District of AR this week. I appreciated their updates on the status and needs of Arkansas water projects and resources.  "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Inflation is up 7.9% – a 40-year high – and it's crushing everyone, including our farmers and ranchers. When their costs go up, it’s a bad day for rural America and a bad day for everyone who works so hard to purchase the food they need to put on the table. Everybody loses. "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Congratulations to Arkansas’s own Heba Abdelaal — USAF Military Spouse of the Year. Very proud of all her efforts in support of our Armed Forces and military families, including on my staff for many years. You can vote for her today for overall  "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,I'm joining Down On The Corner with Dale Hoffman in a few moments to talk about the latest news from Washington and Arkansas.Watch the livestream:  
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"I've enjoyed meeting with Arkansas members of many  service organizations recently whose advocacy is crucial to crafting policy. With their input we’ve made great progress in improving, expanding and modernizing benefits for all veterans."
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,It was a pleasure to sit down with  members alongside  yesterday to discuss a number of their policy priorities. We appreciate the invaluable services and support they provide to Natural State communities and businesses. 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"Just as energy independence is important for our national security, so is our food chain. I've asked the Biden administration to allow farmers and ranchers the flexibility to ensure food security for the U.S. and beyond. This should be a top priority.More ⤵️ "
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,Today  and I remember  Sgt. Joshua Caudell and  Firefighter Jason Lang for what they gave to their respective communities: themselves – totally and unflinchingly. We pray for their loved ones and colleagues mourning these fallen guardians. 
Boozman,JohnBoozman,right,"I'm on the  floor to pay tribute to  Sgt. Joshua Caudell and  Firefighter Jason Lang, first responders in Arkansas who recently lost their lives in service to others.WATCH➡️"
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Judge Jackson will coddle criminals and terrorists, and she will twist or ignore the law to reach the result that she wants. That’s not what we need in a Supreme Court justice, and that’s why I will be voting against her confirmation. "
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,The Chinese Communist Party threatened to cut off America’s access to vital drugs during the pandemic. It’s time to bolster onshore manufacturing of pharmaceuticals to ensure Americans never have to rely on China for lifesaving medicine.
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,I enjoyed catching up with folks from the Fort Smith Chamber this morning in DC. I appreciate the update on the F35 mission! 
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"As a trial judge, Judge Jackson’s sentences were too lenient, but they affected only one criminal at a time.As a Supreme Court Justice, her leniency would be a free pass to criminals nationwide. "
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Canceling regular testing of our nuclear arsenal to appease a brutal dictator is clear sign of weakness. Joe Biden might as well put up a billboard at the White House saying, “I’m afraid of Vladimir Putin.”"
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"As Joe Biden chases an even worse Iran nuclear deal, consider how America’s friends in the region look at things."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Instead of depleting our strategic reserves to cover for his own failures, Joe Biden should admit that he was wrong to shut down drilling at home and commit to energy independence."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,We arrested Huawei executives before for sanctions-busting. We will do it again if they violate Western sanctions.
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,We’re experiencing astonishing surges in illegal immigration at our southern border. Now is not the time for President Biden to loosen immigration restrictions. 
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"As severe weather moves through Arkansas, please stay safe and continue to check local news alerts."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Arkansas farmers grow the safest, most reliable food in the world. They help keep the United States and other nations safe from dependence on China for food, which the Chinese Communist Party would leverage for its own advantage. "
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Group pictures at the NATO headquarters aren’t going to stop Vladimir Putin.Ukrainians need weapons, and they need them now. "
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"The Washington Post confirms that the defendant Judge Brown Jackson sentenced to just 3 months—even though guidelines called for 8-10 years—continued to offend after being released.If he had been sentenced appropriately, this would not have happened."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,Judge Jackson has been a far-left activist for decades. Her years as a judge haven’t changed that. 
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Hawkins’ case has been the centerpiece of Judge Jackson’s hearing. Jackson gave Hawkins a mere three-month sentence—and six years later, he was in trouble again.Leniency for these offenders is unacceptable. "
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"In 2020, well over a million violent crimes went unsolved, but Judge Jackson wouldn’t answer a simple question: does the United States imprison too many or too few violent criminals? "
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Drug overdoses killed more than 100,000 Americans last year.It’s unacceptable to bend the law to give early release to a hardened fentanyl trafficker."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"I’m looking for a justice who will make decisions based on the law, not based on their personal experiences or desired political outcomes. "
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"The hearts of Arkansans from across the state are with the people of Dumas today. I’m grateful to the Arkansas State Police for their work on the case, and I pray that God will bring comfort to the victims and their families."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,Sanctions haven’t stopped the war in Ukraine.It’s time for President Biden to send everything that shoots to our friends in Ukraine. 
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,War is not hell; war is worse than hell. Only the condemned suffer in hell; war condemns the innocent to suffer.Watch this video and ask which aircraft and which weapons we should deny the Ukrainians to protect the innocent. 
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"The wages of Biden’s weakness are Russian tanks rolling through Eastern Europe. If we fail to support Ukraine, the stakes and the flames of war will rise."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,President Zelenskyy asked for MiG-29s. His country is under attack. We should give them to him.It’s as simple as that. 
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,My prayers are with  and his family as we await more information on his condition. 
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,Joe Biden should stop negotiating with the leading state sponsor of terror and start holding Iran accountable for its actions. 
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,Iran is openly targeting Americans with missile strikes. Sanctions relief for Iran’s terrorist regime should be completely off the table.
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"And I reiterate to Vladimir Putin and his military leaders that the intentional targeting of innocent civilians, including reporters, is a war crime."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,Arkansans are saddened today at the death of Brent Renaud in Ukraine. I join them in expressing deepest condolences to the Renaud family. 
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"An offensive, anti-Semitic attack on Israel. Remember this when Amnesty publishes future “reports” about Israel—it doesn’t believe Israel should have the right to exist."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"This massive $1.5 trillion spending bill will fuel the fire of inflation and expand President Biden’s federal bureaucracy. Aid for Ukraine is much needed, but this bill wasn’t the way to pass it."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Costs are rising for Arkansans on everyday necessities like gasoline and groceries, and now Democrats are using the crisis in Europe to push through their liberal wishlist."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Polish MiGs aren’t any more “escalatory” than the anti-aircraft missiles already sent to Ukraine, President Biden is just choosing to drag his feet on the transfer. "
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,We shouldn’t allow the Chinese Communist Party to use its corrupt courts to excuse the theft of American intellectual property.Our bill will help protect U.S. innovation from these lawless “anti-suit injunctions”—a naked attempt to steal American IP. 
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,Helping Ukraine defend itself against a ruthless dictator is in our best interest.Americans recognize that—whether the Biden administration does or not.
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"President Biden should be leading the effort to arm Ukraine—instead, he’s pumping the breaks on Poland’s offer to send warplanes to stop Putin."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,Why does this administration insist on telling Putin what we won’t do?
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,President Biden has been on the back foot since this war started. He needs to recapture the initiative—starting with transferring Polish MiGs to Ukraine.
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"President Biden is moving at the speed of bureaucracy. To beat Putin, he’ll need to move at the speed of war."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,It’s time for President Biden to quit slow rolling our response to Russia’s aggression. Every second wasted puts Ukrainian lives at risk. 
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Instead, he’s dithering and hiding behind lawyers, signaling hesitation and weakness to Putin and a lack of resolve to our allies. "
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,President Biden should have welcomed Poland’s offer to aid Ukraine with MiG-29s—as he should welcome conventional arms transfers of any kind from our NATO partners to defeat Putin’s advance.
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"At $127 per barrel, the United States is sending $25.4M to fund Putin's war machine today. It's time for Biden to sanction Russian oil."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Americans are rejecting the Democratic Party. They’re turning to the Republican Party because we will protect and restore the American Dream, for every American. We will govern with strength, pride, and honor, just as Reagan did."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"The American Dream has been secured by those, generation after generation, willing to endure the nightmare of war. We do not seek conflict, but we do not shrink from it either. So long as our enemies know this, we will keep the peace."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Our troops fight for the flag on their shoulder and the buddies to their left and right. They don’t fight for abstractions like the “rules-based international order,” or “diversity,” or “climate change."""
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Putin wagered that if the American president wouldn’t stand up to a depraved gang of seventh-century savages in Afghanistan, there was no way he would stand up to Russia."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"The Republican Party must always remain the party of work, protecting the opportunity to work, the dignity of work, and the value of work."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"For too long, our leaders have adopted short-term and short-sighted economic policies, selling off the inheritance of our ancestors for short-lived profit. We’ve been governed from quarter to quarter—as if America is a corporation, not a nation. This era must come to an end."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Free trade isn’t free unless it flows both ways. China isn’t engaged in free trade, not even close."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"China’s entry into the WTO in 2001 began a hollowing out of America’s industrial base, economy, and working class. Many states, like mine, have lost a quarter of their manufacturing jobs. Factories closed, families splintered, and opportunities crumbled."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,Both parties are complicit in one of the single worst mistakes of this generation: granting Communist China Permanent Most Favored Nation status and admitting it into the World Trade Organization.
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"We must invest more in American workers, pay them more, and treat them better. The days of importing their replacements must come to an end."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,The right amount of illegal immigration is zero.
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,But the level of immigration—legal and illegal—has been too high for too long. And too many immigrants come here without needed skills or any means of support. They’re admitted instead by the random chance of geographic proximity or family connections.
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Many immigrants are our greatest patriots, leaving behind impoverished, dangerous, and unfree countries for this land of hope. America takes great pride in them, their accomplishments, and their attachment to our shared nation."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"We must reject the ideology of globalism, which claims that wide-open borders and wide-open markets are the path to prosperity for all. America’s shuttered factories, boarded-up main streets, and derelict drug dens stand as grim monuments that rebuke this theory."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"The phrase “America First” gives the vapors to globalists in both parties, partly because of its World War Two-era disrepute, but to the Jacksonian ear, it sounds like simple, obvious common sense. If we don’t put America first, who will?"
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"That starts with a basic truth rejected by Democrats and, unfortunately, too many Republicans: we are a nation with an economy, not an economy with a nation. We are a people with principles, not a set of principles with a people."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"We must rebuild an economy that works for all citizens, especially the forgotten men and women left behind by decades of open borders, unfettered trade, and globalization."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Our party should reverse this and once again put hardened, career criminals where they belong—back behind bars."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"For four years, I led the fight against the First Step Act, when nearly everyone was on the other side, including former President Trump, in the worst mistake of his tenure."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,No piece of legislation did more to harm Republicans' status as the party of public safety than the First Step Act.
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"They’ve contributed to the worst increase in murder rates on record and the most drug-overdose deaths ever. There’s only one answer to these radicals: Republicans must work to recall, remove, and replace every last Soros prosecutor."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"In many Democratic-run cities, prosecutors refuse to prosecute. These “progressive” or “Soros prosecutors” haven’t just abused prosecutorial discretion, they’ve embraced prosecutorial nullification, ruling entire categories of serious crimes out of bounds for prosecution."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Here, too, Democrats have abandoned the American people—especially our most vulnerable citizens."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Along with protecting our liberty and preserving it for our posterity, our founders also understood that protecting our people from violence, crime, and the breakdown of law and order is another chief responsibility for the government."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Republicans are the party of opportunity, achievement, and excellence for all. We’ll keep schools open, involve parents as partners in their kid’s education, teach kids the skills they need, and restore patriotic education."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Republicans must protect America’s kids from left-wing madness. As Reagan understood, a nation cannot long survive if its schoolchildren don’t learn basic skills but do learn to hate their country."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"We shouldn’t be cowed by a dishonest media that conspires with the Democrats and Big Tech to cancel, censor, and smear normal Americans."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"The Democratic Party has abandoned the soul of Jacksonian Democracy, grounded in a deep and simple love of country, community, and American culture. They have cast aside those attributes embodied by the likes of Jackson and Washington: duty, honor, loyalty."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"For nearly two centuries, Democratic Party faithful celebrated President Jackson, seeing themselves as the party of the common man aligned against the forces of wealth and inherited power. Not anymore."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Ronald Reagan understood what every Republican officeholder must remember: we are elected first and foremost to protect the American people, their prosperity, and their freedom."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Tonight, I'll be joining the Reagan Institute's Time for Choosing Speaker Series. You can watch my speech live here at 9 pm ET :"
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"At $118 per barrel, the United States is sending $23.6M to fund Putin's war machine today. It's time for Biden to sanction Russian oil."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"At $115 per barrel, the United States is sending $23M to fund Putin's war machine today. It's time for Biden to sanction Russian oil."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Thank you, President , for your hospitality and friendship to our nation. We appreciate your sober, clear-eyed leadership during these dangerous times.We look forward to welcoming Finnish F-35 pilots to Arkansas! "
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"At $112 per barrel, the United States is sending $22.4M to fund Putin's war machine today. It's time for Biden to sanction Russian oil."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"While Putin levels Ukrainian cities, President Biden is partnering with Russia to ease sanctions on the terrorist Iranian regime. Shameful."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"At $110 per barrel, America is sending $22M to fund Putin's war machine today. It's time for Biden to sanction Russian oil."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,Thanks to  Director Lorie Tudor and her team for the update on Arkansas transportation and infrastructure. 
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"My bill would have ended our funding of Russia’s war machine, but Democrats blocked the motion and chose to prioritize far-left policies instead."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,This afternoon I’ll ask the Senate to pass my bill to allow new oil and gas leases on federal land.The choice between Russian energy and American energy shouldn’t be difficult. My bill would end support for Russia and lower the cost of gas.
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,Democrats are too dangerously naive and ideological to defend America.
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,Democrats are insisting we subtract military support for Ukraine from our own defense spending. This is a non-starter.Any emergency spending bill for Ukraine must include lethal assistance. President Zelensky has called for ammo. We should send him ammo.
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,President Biden must extend sanctions on all Russian banks to cripple the Kremlin’s war machine. Anything less is total failure. 
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"Officer Caudell sacrificed his life while protecting his community and defending the rule of law. I pray that God will bring comfort to his family, friends, and fellow officers during this difficult time, and I trust his killer will be brought to justice."
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,This is the right move. But the aid must be lethal and needs to be delivered right now. There is not a second to lose. 
Cotton,SenTomCotton,right,"We should expel Russia from SWIFT immediately, and sanction Russia's central bank."

Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,The Administration negotiated a bad international tax deal for American businesses and workers.  and I are urging them to work with Congress to negotiate a deal that protects U.S. economic strength. 
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"The Administration’s FY2023 Health and Human Services budget request provided a chance to chart a more thoughtful return to normalcy, continuity and fiscal responsibility. Disappointingly, it does not rise to that occasion. Watch my full statement: "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Larry Gebert has appeared on TV stations in Idaho living rooms for more than 3 decades. He was a tireless advocate and philanthropist for many needs in the Treasure Valley. My condolences and prayers are with his family, KTVB colleagues, and loved ones. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"The southern border saw record-high illegal border crossings in 2021, and encounters are expected to skyrocket again this year once the Administration rescinds Title 42. The President must take steps to secure the border now.  "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"I joined  and  to introduce the Stop Fentanyl Border Crossings Act, which will help address the public health crisis facilitated by drug smuggling &amp; keep a tighter grip on illegal border crossings. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"We need transparent federal nominees committed to improving our economy through greater spending discipline &amp; policies that fuel economic growth, not inflation. Read more here: "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"We also need free trade agreements in the Indo-Pacific so that those countries can strengthen economic relationships with us, rather than China. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Free trade is a force for good – Idaho is proof of that. International trade supports hundreds of thousands of Idaho jobs, and comprehensive free trade agreements are critical to our state’s economy. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,Until Idaho’s farmers are able to sell high-quality potatoes to every family in Mexico--as is their right under the USMCA--I will continue pushing  to ensure Mexico upholds its commitments under this trade agreement. 
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Fresh data on consumer price inflation shows an increase in the PCE price index to 6.4%, well above the Fed's 2.0% target for inflation. Families can’t keep up. It’s incredible that the Administration continues to push for more inflationary, reckless spending and sky-high taxes. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,Over 1.1M migrants were expelled pursuant to Title 42 over the last year. This move will only exacerbate the record-breaking crisis at the southern border. The Administration should have policies in place to secure the border and enforce all immigration laws 
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"We have the opportunity to better support Americans by ensuring we have access to high-quality mental health care services. While there is no easy solution, I am committed to bipartisan and fiscally responsible solutions. Watch my statement at a hearing on mental health: "

Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"More federal spending, even for temporary relief, will ultimately result in higher inflationary pressures. Providing stimulus checks for high gas prices ignores a core cause of this crisis: Democrats’ unrestrained spending and war on American energy. "

Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,Gas prices increased 48% from the time Biden took office to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. To suggest prices are high because of Russia ignores the Administration’s war on American energy. 
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Skyrocketing inflation and gas prices have been more than a year in the making. The Administration’s spending policies and hostile regulatory agenda set a crippling inflation foundation, and everyday Americans are paying the price. "

Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Read more about the Lower Costs, More Cures Act--my bill to tackle prescription drug prices and encourage new treatments--in  Healthcare Special Section: What’s ailing health care? A Policy Prognosis 2022.    "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Congress should pursue solutions that reduce out-of-pocket drug spending, particularly for seniors. My Lower Costs, More Cures Act leverages targeted policies with bipartisan backing to address Americans' needs at the pharmacy counter, the hospital, and the doctor’s office. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Rather than considering further damaging measures, Congress should be taking practical steps to address runaway inflation through greater spending discipline, and policies that fuel job and small business growth."
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"While soaring energy prices have largely driven inflation, everything from food to clothing to airfare has accelerated to burdensome highs for consumers. To argue that we can spend our way out of inflation, as some Democrats are currently suggesting we do, is simply not credible. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"As inflation and gas prices skyrocket to new highs, it is time for President Biden to change his mind on another issue that empowers Vladimir Putin: domestic energy production. American oil and gas production must replace Russian energy imports. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,This claim also ignores 14 months of Democrats’ attacks on the American oil &amp; gas industry. The Admin should work with Congress to take steps to address runaway inflation through greater spending discipline &amp; policies that fuel job growth &amp; tap our energy sources here at home.
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"President Biden wants to blame gas prices on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but skyrocketing gas prices have been more than a year in the making. His claim ignores the Admin's reckless spending over the last 14 months, &amp; a 40% increase in gas prices prior to the invasion. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Putin cannot enjoy the same trade status as our NATO allies and other international partners. Instead, Russia belongs in the same pariah trade status as North Korea and Cuba. Read my thoughts on how to further weaken Putin here: "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,My statement on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s address to Congress: 
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"I oppose the Admin’s sweeping, one-size-fits-all mandates on vaccines and masks, which is why I voted in favor of a CRA to nullify the federal travel mask mandate rule. Decisions with respect to COVID should shift to individual responsibility, rather than top-down fed mandates. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"My long-time Communications Director, Lindsay Nothern, will retire this week after 23 years of service in the U.S. Senate. He has taken on each challenge with great compassion &amp; persistent optimism. Thank you, Lindsay, for your service on behalf of the great people of Idaho. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,The Admin's open-border policies have de-prioritized the removal of dangerous criminals here illegally. My colleagues &amp; I sent a letter to DHS Secretary Mayorkas demanding answers on the impact of the Admin’s negligence on crime in American communities.  
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,My statement after Sarah Bloom Raskin withdrew her nomination to serve as Vice Chair for Supervision at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors: 
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Vibrant trade links are essential to building trust and cooperation in different areas of the world. The U.S. must chart an ambitious trade policy agenda with key partners, including in the Indo-Pacific Region, because if we don’t write the rules, China will. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,This inflation foundation was set in place well before price pressures from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine took hold. The Admin’s reckless spending policies and hostile regulatory agenda significantly contributed to this highly inflationary environment.  
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,I will continue to work to protect law-abiding citizens’ Second Amendment rights. 
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"I joined colleagues on a letter to AG Garland &amp; ATF to express our concern over the ATF's continued pattern of enforcing secret guidance, which has been used to justify the seizure of property &amp; could be used to prosecute law-abiding Americans. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Donavan has donned his uniform proudly and hopes to re-enlist as an active duty servicemember next year. Thank you, Donavan, for your dedication and commitment to service. "

Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Inflation has reached to 40-year highs under this Administration, leaving Idahoans to face soaring prices for expenses. Congress must work to address the effects of inflation and exercise greater discipline over spending, deficits and debt. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"The President responded to calls from Congress and announced his support to suspend Russia’s trade relations status with the U.S. We should quickly pass the bipartisan, bicameral legislation I’ve introduced with  Committee Chair . "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Enjoyed meeting with members of the Idaho Farm Bureau. These meetings are critical to gaining unique, local perspectives on the industry’s most pressing issues, and help guide my efforts to strengthen Idaho’s agriculture industry. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"I signed this letter, and implore the President to act without delay to provide urgently needed airpower that will bolster the ability of the Ukrainian armed forces to defend their country and help save civilian lives. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"I stand with  and the Idaho community’s steadfast support for Ukraine in their fight for freedom and democracy, and against Russia’s unwarranted acts of aggression. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,The legislation: - Bans the import of Russian energy products  - Suspends Russia &amp; Belarus PNTR status - Allows the Administration to further increase tariffs  - Provides Congress the ability to overturn attempts to lift the ban
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Congress must bring more pressure against Russia. I’ve introduced legislation that reflects a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to ban the import of energy products from Russia, and to suspend permanent normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"The Administration’s reckless spending and misguided energy policies have led to record-breaking inflation. While Russian aggression and necessary responses are sure to push prices even higher, skyrocketing inflation has been more than a year in the making. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Energy independence is a matter of national and economic security. Now is the time to develop and tap into the resources here at home, not diminish them. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,Energy independence is a matter of national and economic security. Fed efforts to develop regulations that limit U.S. energy producers’ access to credit and capital are unprecedented and alarming. 
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,The Senate's passage of the Health Care for Burn Pits Veterans Act is a critical step toward ensuring our veterans have access to the services and care they have earned. 
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"This private-sector-driven initiative will help to drastically lower insulin costs for Idahoans, which is even more vital during this time of high inflation and economic uncertainty."
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"I commend  and Civica for taking steps to cut costs for these life-saving drugs through free-market competition and American manufacturing, delivering affordable access to insulin in communities across Idaho and the rest of the nation. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"My column addresses the 2022 tax filing season, which is shaping up to be a frustrating mess. The IRS must use its existing authorities to immediately provide targeted, temporary relief to taxpayers and reduce backlogs. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"As global demand for energy continues to increase, we can address the harmful effects of inflation and continue to crack down on Russia by supporting and increasing America’s energy independence."
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"W/ the Russia-Ukraine war at the forefront, I asked Fed Chair Powell if he expects strains on the oil or energy markets to increase inflation, given Russia’s role as a major oil and gas exporter. He indicated the short term impact would be great, adding to inflationary pressures. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"On behalf of all Idahoans, congrats to Dani Aravich, Jesse Keefe, Jake Adicoff &amp; Josh Sweeney on representing the U.S. at the 2022 . We're wishing nothing but the best for each of you, and will be cheering you on each step of the way. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"169 years ago today, President Lincoln signed congressional action that would create the Idaho territory. Happy  as we commemorate the occasion and celebrate our state's rich history and bright future. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"The notion that we should use our fed regulatory authorities to decide which industries are optimal &amp; restrict those we don’t like from having access to capital is alarming. This mimics the Obama-era Operation Choke Point, which I have fought for years. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"I asked Federal Reserve Acting Chair Jerome Powell if he believes the Federal Reserve should pursue standards in its supervisory capacity to stop or restrict so-called “sub-optimal industries” from having access to capital. He responded by simply stating, “No, I do not”. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Putin miscalculated the will of Ukrainians to fight for their own freedom, &amp; the support from NATO countries &amp; other parts of the world against Russia’s barbaric actions. We must continue to support efforts to deter Russia’s aggression &amp; support the resilient Ukrainian people. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Sarah Bloom Raskin continues to evade important questions raised by several members on the Banking Committee, and the Committee should not be compelled to move forward with considering her nomination until she has adequately addressed those outstanding concerns. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"While inflation continues to hammer Americans’ pocketbooks, it is also contributing to our skyrocketing federal debt that will burden future generations. More reckless spending will only add fuel to the fire. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"The Biden Administration wants $30B more for COVID relief, amid major concerns over the accounting of existing relief funds. Americans needs answers on the allocation of funds before considering additional COVID relief. "
Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Due to a scheduling conflict, I can no longer attend this event, but I encourage you to watch to understand the urgent need to move forward on this legislative path to provide support for Ukraine’s ability to defend itself, while imposing real costs on Russia for its actions. "

Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Today, I told the Idaho State Legislature that Idaho has fared far better than other states during the pandemic. We consistently lead the way in economic growth, regulation reduction and creditworthiness—making our state a magnet for free enterprise and ingenuity. "

Crapo,MikeCrapo,right,"Americans are painfully aware that inflation has soared to 7.5%, the highest rate since 1982. This is clearly a result of excessive overspending, and more spending and tax hikes will only make things worse. "
Risch,SenatorRisch,right,"As we pay tribute to the service &amp; sacrifice of our fallen servicemembers, we hold in our hearts the spouses who shoulder the price paid for the defense of the freedoms &amp; liberties we enjoy every day. To the  of Idaho – thank you. America stands with you. "
Risch,SenatorRisch,right,"Idaho has been on the leading edge of cutting red tape, but federal regulations continue to have far-reaching effects on small businesses &amp; taxpayers. DC should follow Idaho’s lead in reducing costly regulations with this effective one-in, two-out rule."

Risch,SenatorRisch,right,"President Biden is touting his $5.8 trillion budget as a money-saver. However, it is plagued with wasteful spending on left-wing programs &amp; budget gimmicks that do not honestly account for its cost. This is no bargain. This is another ticking inflation time bomb."

Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,The 1955 lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till serves as a stark reminder of what happens when hate and bigotry go unchecked. We must never forget—and never diminish—the history of lynching in America. Glad to be with President Biden to see this bill over the finish line. 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"I’m on the Senate floor, discussing last week’s  SCOTUS hearings and the latest on Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Watch live: "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"I had a few special guests at last week's hearings: Law students from Howard University and my alma mater, Georgetown Law, as well as  interns. They watched Judge Jackson prove that—through hard work, a commitment to the law, and grit and grace—she's earned this seat."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Despite the behavior from some in the hearings, last week was an inspiration for so many in this country. From her incredible life story to her temperament in the hearing room, Judge Jackson has shown America that she can rise to any challenge as a Justice on the Supreme Court. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Clarity and impartiality. That is Judge Jackson.I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a look at this nominee and what she will bring to the Court. She is the best and deserves our support. 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Due to the nature of their subjects, these investigations present heightened constitutional and civil liberties concerns and therefore merit greater scrutiny and supervision. Glad to join my friend and colleague, Senator Grassley, in this important oversight work. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"President Biden's budget lays out bold priorities for America to create good paying jobs, provide safety and security at home and abroad, improve our economy, and much more. I’ll work to get this across the finish line to deliver for American families and communities. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Speaking live on the Senate floor 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Today I joined hundreds of Ukrainians and their supporters in Chicago for a rally in protest of the unprovoked and unjustified Russian military invasion of Ukraine. 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,I joined Senator Duckworth at  today to discuss the $1.5 million in federal funding we secured for flood resilience efforts in historically underserved communities. This funding will help reduce flooding of homes and prevent further environmental harm. 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"I had the pleasure of participating in the groundbreaking for the newest  clinic, which will further expand access to care for underserved communities. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, community health centers can launch capital improvement projects like this. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"After a historic week in Washington, I was glad to join the next generation of lawyers at  today to discuss Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination hearings and the work of . "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Putin is afraid of a peaceful, democratic Ukraine and of how that might inspire Russians who want the same."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,This is high praise from someone who knows a thing or two about the law and our nation’s federal courts. The Honorable Ann Claire Williams is a trailblazer in her own respect—so it means that much more to hear her speak this way about Judge Jackson. 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"What impressed me most about Judge Jackson wasn't just her experience, sterling record, or poise—it was her ability to let all of those show and shine no matter what was being thrown at her. She will make a fantastic Supreme Court Justice. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again—there are 100 Senators, but there is only 1 . Make sure you take the time to hear what he had to say to Judge Jackson in  today. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Today, we lost a true public servant. A refugee herself, Secretary Albright was a glass ceiling breaker, a champion for democracy and human rights, and a true model of what it means to be an American diplomat. May her legacy serve as a guiding light to future generations."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"At the end of the day, Judge Jackson, the President alone chose you. He has put his faith in you to deliver justice on the highest court in the land. I share that faith. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,There is exactly one living Senator who has effectively changed the size of the Supreme Court—and that was Republican Leader Senator McConnell when he blocked President Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland. 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,ICYMI: Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson describes her judicial philosophy to . 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will continue to make history today.Day two of her landmark confirmation process: 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,I’ll be on   shortly to recap the first day of Judge Jackson’s Supreme Court nomination hearing yesterday and preview what’s to come today. Tune in.
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"You, Judge Jackson, are one of Mr. Lincoln’s living witnesses of an America that is unafraid of challenge, willing to risk change, confident of the basic goodness of our citizens. And you are a living witness to the fact that, in America, all is possible. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Judge Jackson has ruled for and against Presidents of both political parties. For and against prosecutors and defendants. For and against workers and employers.She will not be a rubber-stamp for this President, or any President. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Today is an historic day for the United States of America. In its more than 230 years, the Supreme Court has had 115 Justices. Not a single one has been a Black woman. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will be the first. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will make history today as the first Black woman to ever appear before  as a nominee to the Supreme Court.Watch day one of this landmark confirmation process: 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Today, the Senate will begin the historic hearings to consider Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination to the Supreme Court. To watch the livestream and get the latest information on Judge Jackson's hearing, follow the Committee's official account ."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"As I said the day Judge Jackson's nomination to  was announced, it's hard to think of a better jurist to replace the highly regarded Justice Stephen Breyer. And after meeting with her, I am only more impressed by her experience, character, and fidelity to our Constitution. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Great meeting today with , , &amp; ATU Local 308 to discuss transit worker safety in Chicago &amp; across the country. The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment &amp; Jobs Act includes critical protections for transit workers that I’m working with ATU to implement."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Sheriff  is right. The Senate can and must right the wrongs of the war on drugs by passing the EQUAL Act and finally ending the crack &amp; powder cocaine sentencing disparity. 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"This week, I was honored to attend a Joint Session of Congress address by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. I also support President Biden’s announcement to send additional military aid as part of the humanitarian, military, and economic support package for Ukraine. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"This coming Monday, I will gavel in the hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court. It will surely mark as one of the highest honors of my career in Congress. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"While we must condemn all violence, it's abundantly clear that white supremacists &amp; violent militia extremists are the most significant domestic terrorism threat facing us today. The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act will help the federal government forcefully combat this threat. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Rooting for you tonight, . You make Illinois proud! "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Thank you  for taking action to protect Illinois veterans from a predatory school. These defrauded veterans should have their benefits restored by . 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"I’m live on the Senate floor, celebrating World Water Day and previewing next week’s SCOTUS confirmation hearings in .Watch here: "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Had the chance to meet with  in Washington today. He is a fearless Russian patriot and leader for democracy who—despite being poisoned twice by the Kremlin—continues to stand up to Putin. His path, the path of democracy and peace, is what Russia needs right now. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Thousands of children—some mere infants—were forcibly removed from their parents by the Trump Admin and hundreds remain separated to this day. I applaud the ongoing, morally necessary work of the Biden Admin’s Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,". deserves praise and thanks for his determined leadership on this bill. Because of his efforts, it will soon be signed into law by President Biden.Congratulations, my friend. This is an historic moment. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"I want to thank , ,  for their partnership and tireless leadership on this bill, as well as , , , and . This historic moment was a multi-Committee team effort on both sides of the aisle."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"At a moment when nearly one in three women—one in three—have experienced some form of physical or sexual violence, a crisis that's grown worse during the pandemic,  is going to help save lives. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Spoke with  Commander General Van Ovost today about military readiness priorities and the role that  and the 182nd Wing in Peoria are equipped to play. Time and again, they have demonstrated their capabilities—I hope to see them further utilized."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Best of luck, ! Illinois is rooting for you. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Had a great conversation with  and Illinois Mayors yesterday about how best to rebuild our communities and make historic, much-needed investments in our infrastructure. I’ll continue to be a strong federal representative for IL as we look to build a brighter future."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"I commend the Biden Admin for designating Afghanistan for Temporary Protected Status. TPS will protect Afghans in the U.S. from being forced to return to unsafe conditions due to the ongoing conflict and deteriorating conditions, incl. water scarcity &amp; a worsening hunger crisis."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Putin’s indiscriminate murdering of innocent Ukrainians has sealed his fate in history as a war criminal. 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"VAWA reauthorization is a monumental achievement for survivors of domestic and sexual violence. It may be long overdue, but I could not be more proud of how hard this group worked to get this done.It’s time we finally build a world—and legal system—that puts survivors first. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"President Zelensky’s speech to Congress today was powerful. Putin has unleashed a savage war of death and destruction on a peaceful, sovereign nation. The U.S. must continue to provide Ukraine with the military and humanitarian supplies it needs to fight back and save lives."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Glad to see  sign the omnibus spending package today. In addition to key aid for Ukraine, it includes more than $200 million for projects in Illinois—infrastructure, health care, environmental conservation, community violence initiatives, and more."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Our nation is built on some fundamental ideas—like fairness. But millions of women across the U.S. are still doing the same job as men and being paid less for their work. On , I stand with women across the country in calling for equal pay for equal work."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Congratulations to Illinois’ own Josh Misiewicz and Kevin McKee for being a part of this historic accomplishment. Making us proud! 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Speaking live on the Senate floor: 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Real courage in these brief seconds speaking truth about Putin’s savagery in Ukraine. Why is Putin afraid of letting his people know the truth?
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Putin’s bombing of the training camp in Lviv hits close to home. I visited the camp &amp; had lunch with US troops several years ago. Putin is pushing the NATO question, striking 11 miles from Poland. I fully support diplomacy over war, but we have to be prepared now more than ever."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"The Chicago Ukrainian rally on Sunday was a remarkable display of unity. Flags from Poland, Lithuania, and many other nations joined the many blue and gold banners from Ukraine. The valiant people of Ukraine are inspiring the world."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Every Illinoisan deserves access to a secure &amp; reliable retirement savings vehicle. I had an important and fruitful discussion with  today about how the federal gov't can support IL in establishing a stronger sense of financial security for Illinoisans. 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Putin spews grievances from his ill-gotten luxury palace while murdering innocent Ukrainians and jailing peaceful Russians who condemn his war. 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Last week’s meeting brought ten European Ambassadors to the U.S. together with . One could sense that President Biden’s efforts have created a rebirth of NATO exactly when the world needs it. 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Speaking live on the Senate floor: 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Tragic news that Putin’s bombs destroyed a maternity hospital in Ukraine and took the lives of a mother and her baby. 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"For those who are less than familiar with Judge Jackson, let me tell you a little bit about her: Highly qualified. A breadth of experience. Committed to our Constitution.My dearest hope is that at the end of the day, she will receive the bipartisan support she has earned. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Tradition returned to the South Side of Chicago Sunday with the St. Patrick’s Day Parade. Fallen heroes CPD Ofc. Ella French and the CFD’s MaShawn Plummer were honored, and their families and wounded CPD Ofc. Carlos Yanez Jr.—French’s partner—were on hand. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Praying for all those affected by gun violence over the weekend in Chicago. We must never allow ourselves to normalize mass shootings and violence like this. We must continue to push for commonsense gun safety reforms and safer, more peaceful communities."
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,Great to be back at the St. Patrick’s Day Parade in Chicago on Saturday. 
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,"Had a productive discussion with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Rock Island District Commander Colonel Jesse Curry last week about bringing several Illinois water infrastructure projects, including the Quincy Bay Restoration Project, to fruition. "
Durbin,SenatorDurbin,left,My office is closely monitoring the unfolding situation around the Marathon Pipeline leak. We are in contact with  and  and will continue to do everything we can to ensure federal resources are available if necessary to help with the clean-up.
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Since Biden got into office, there have been over 2 million migrant encounters at the border. Now, he wants to remove the only barrier left, Title 42. Why does Biden refuse to protect the American people? "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Most Americans don’t have an extra $5,200 laying around. And now Biden wants to spend even more money we don't have. "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Americans with life-threatening diseases can't wait for D.C.'s red tape. Families like the Slivkas are why we need the  now.  
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"It's time to advance drug development for life-threatening diseases. We can secure access to safe, promising therapies for patients while maintaining FDA standards.Patients deserve a VOICE in PDUFA.Patients deserve SOLUTIONS in PDUFA.  Promising Pathway Act is the solution."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Promising Pathway Act increases innovation in clinical trial design and encourages sponsors to use real world data to ascertain the benefits of the drug without reducing the FDA’s standard of safety or effectiveness.
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Promising Pathway Act requires FDA to use a rolling, priority review pathway to evaluate drugs intended to treat, prevent, or diagnose serious diseases. Provisional approval is granted to drugs demonstrating substantial evidence of safety &amp; early evidence of positive outcomes."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Promising Pathway Act gives people with serious and life-threatening illnesses a fighting chance to receive timely access to innovative treatments in America—and patients are willing and wanting to take on the challenge.   
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,FDA’s slow and overly burdensome regulatory pathways prevent patients with no treatment options and little time to wait from accessing a potentially life-saving drug—often driving them to OTHER countries for treatment. This is unacceptable.
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"FDA’s current failure to approve safe and effective treatments for devastating diseases means the difference between life and death for patients with ALS, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, childhood DIPG, and more."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"As new and promising therapies for patients with serious and life-threatening disease advance, my Promising Pathway Act allows  to modernize its review pathways WITHOUT sacrificing FDA’s foundational role in ensuring safety and efficacy.  "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Patients have been sidelined for far too long in this process, and that cycle MUST STOP with this reauthorization—as my letter notes, there can be no rubberstamping of this FDA user fee bill."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,That is why I wrote  and  today to ask for a hearing focused on PATIENTS in the context of the FDA user fee reauthorization. Read it here⬇️
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Senate HELP Committee’s Tuesday hearing launches its  user fee reauthorization process—make no mistake, no reauthorization is complete without fulsome patient input.     "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,The radical left is running the White House. 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"By ending Title 42, President Biden is welcoming hundreds of thousands more illegal immigrants to enter the U.S. on top of the millions already crossing. His staff has said they know this will cause an 'influx' yet are still doing it. The radical left is running the White House."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Joe Biden's weak policies put a ""WELCOME"" sign on our southern border from day one. "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,The federal government should not be pushing sex change surgery and experimental hormone therapies on kids. I signed on to the End Taxpayer Funding of Gender Experimentation Act and the Empower Parents to Protect Their Kids Act to stop this radical agenda.
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"There have been 805,157 encounters with migrants at the border less than 6 months into FY 2022.There were 405,036 encounters with migrants in the entire FY2020.Does Biden still not find an issue with this?"
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Obama’s DHS Secretary said 1,000 border crossings a day is a crisis. He said he couldn’t imagine what 4,000 crossings a day would look like. We’re now up to 7,000 per day!"
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Disappointed to see ’s vote against Amylyx's ALS drug. We need my Promising Pathway Act to provide the regulatory framework necessary for rare disease drug development and expediting beneficial outcomes for patients.The ALS community does not have time to lose.
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Biden’s Budget would wreck the economy and bankrupt our children and grandchildren. 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"We're over 2 years in - Americans and businesses know how to deal with COVID. A heavy handed approach causes far more harm than good, and America is better off ignoring Anthony Fauci. "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"It is a win for America that David Weil’s nomination to be Wage &amp; Hour Administrator failed. President Biden nominated an out-of-touch academic who would’ve used the Labor Dept to push anti-worker policies against independent contractors, entrepreneurs, and the gig economy."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,It's like they're purposefully trying to ruin the country. 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"How can Biden continue his reckless spending when the American people are struggling to pay for gas, food, and housing due to his inflation crisis?"
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Every American is paying for Joe Biden's liberal economic agenda. Today I had the opportunity to question his director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Senate Budget Committee. 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"In February, 164,973 individuals tried to cross our southern border illegally—a 63% increase from a year ago. The  is out of control and it’s time for Biden to secure our border NOW!"
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,I joined 's letter calling on AG Garland to rescind his memo comparing parents speaking up for their kids with domestic terrorists. Parents are the primary stakeholder in their kids' education.
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,The Congressional Budget Office is required by law to provide budget projections by February 15.It's March 29th and they still haven't. They're saying it won't be out until May.Congress is supposed to use those projections to report our budget on April 15. 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Biden has once again nominated an out-of-touch academic that promotes anti-worker policies.The future of entrepreneurs and the gig economy in America will be in danger if David Weil is confirmed as the Administrator of the Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division.
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,It was great to welcome and hear from Hoosiers in our nation’s capital at our weekly  this morning! 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Join me in thanking and honoring our Vietnam veterans today on National Vietnam War Veteran’s Day! Of the 400,000 veterans in Indiana, 35 percent of them served during the Vietnam War. We are grateful for your service and sacrifice. "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,We’re on the road to Jimmy Carter-style stagflation because of President Biden can’t stop spending money we don’t have. 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Biden’s budget spending spree would make inflation worse. YOU are going to end up paying for this.
Braun,SenatorBraun,right, 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,This didn't come out of the blue. Joe Biden and Democrats' built an inflation bomb with their reckless spending. 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Like  once said, you have to pass the bill to find out what's in it. Now we know what's in their ""COVID relief"" bill: a bunch of pay-offs, pet projects, and inflation. "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Thanks to Pro-TEQ in Clay Co for introducing me to the team and how they help Americans safely exercise their 2nd Amendment right to defend themselves and their families.  
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Nancy Pelosi doesn’t care that you’re getting gouged as long as she gets her luxury hotels and ski slopes paid for on your dime.I’m outraged, and now that Americans see what was in that ""COVID relief"" bill, they should be too. "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Last year I predicted Americans would be ""outraged"" when they found out what was in Democrats' so-called ""COVID relief"" bill: pay-offs, waste, and a recipe for runaway inflation. Now we see what your money is really being spent on:"
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Only 31% of respondents in this new poll approve of President Biden's handling of the economy because Americans are paying for his incompetence every single day. 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"""COVID relief"" funds are being spent building high-end hotels and improving sprinklers for golf courses. This money must be repaid!"
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Biden's ""COVID relief"" bill was full of waste &amp; pet projects.State &amp; local governments spending COVID aid money on wasteful projects must repay those taxpayer funds to the federal government so we can put it toward paying down our $30T national debt."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"The ""COVID relief"" bill that Democrats rammed through along party lines last year is now funding luxury hotels and new golf course sprinklers. Remember that when they tell you they need more."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Last year I said Biden &amp; Democrats’ “COVID relief” was less than 10% related to COVID and jammed with wasteful spending and liberal pet projects. Now we see what your money is really being spent on:Luxury hotels, ballparks, and ski slopes!"
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Girls’ sports should be for girls, and allowing biological males to compete with them robs female athletes of a chance to compete and win. I’m disappointed Governor Holcomb vetoed a bill to make this law in Indiana, and I support a veto override to protect women’s athletics."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Praying for the family, friends, and community of Capt. Matthew Tomkiewicz from Fort Wayne, Indiana, one of the four Marines who died on Friday in Norway during a NATO exercise when their aircraft crashed. We honor Capt. Tomkiewicz’s service and we’ll never forget his sacrifice."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Take the masks off our toddlers. 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,My statement on President Zelensky of Ukraine's address to Congress: 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"""At their retreat last week in Philadelphia House Democrats called on Americans to make shared sacrifices to protect democracy. Congress itself, however, got a waiver.""Earmarks are back, and worse than ever.  "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Exclusive - Sen. Mike Braun: Earmarks in $1.5 Trillion Omnibus BIll 'Opened the Floodgates' of Abuse ⁦⁩ 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"“The silver lining here, if there is one, is that Indiana Sen. Mike Braun offered an amendment to eliminate these pork projects.”  "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Let’s go Hoosiers!  
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,I’ll be joining  coming up soon to talk about all the dysfunction here in D.C. - lot to talk about.
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"This spending bill is a disgrace: it spends more money on swamp earmarks than it does on humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and while inflation hits record highs D.C.’s answer is to spend another trillion dollars we don’t have. NO, NO, NO."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Congress got rid of earmarks 10 years ago. But now the swamp has brought them back. Tonight 34 of my colleagues joined my amendment to cut the 367 pages and $8 billion of pork barrel pet projects out of this spending bill. We won’t give up!
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"If you'd like to see the rest of the pet projects your money is being spent on, I've posted all of them on my website:"
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"One earmark sends $300,000 to the Alliance for Gun Responsibility Foundation, a left-wing lobbying group a who claims that the Second Amendment “has a history of being used as a tool of White Supremacy.”"
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"One spends $1.6 million for university research into “equitable shellfish aquaculture.”I don't know what that is, but I know you're paying for it."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,One earmark from New York spends half a million dollars to “promote health equity in local Yonkers pools.”
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Tonight the Senate will vote on my amendment to cut all the $8 billion worth of earmarks out of this spending bill. Earmarks are pet projects that lawmakers stuff into spending bills to spend your money on.Here are some of the earmarks in this bill:
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,This spending bill has 367 pages' worth of earmarks. I printed it all out to take it to the Senate floor: that's about 4 pounds of pork right here!Cut every one! 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"We’ve put our spending onto auto-pilot, which has made the Budget Committee a useless appendage."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Speaking on the floor right now on my amendment to cut the pork from this spending bill!
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,This omnibus spending bill has 367 pages of earmarks - or pork barrel pet projects - totaling over $8 billion. Tonight I'm filing an amendment to cut every one of them.
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Inflation hits a new record and D.C.’s response is to spend more money we don’t have.
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"This spending bill text was released at 1:30AM on Wednesday. The House passed it 20 hours later. That means they either reviewed a billion dollars a minute, or didn't read it at all."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"While inflation hits a historic high today, Congress is pushing through one of the largest spending bills in history with $1.5 trillion of your dollars going toward politician pet projects."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,This spending bill is loaded with pork and pet projects. 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Why does the CDC say you need a mask in only one of these aisles? 🤔 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,End the mandates! 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,President Biden singlehandedly kneecapped American energy independence with his disinvestment in the American fuel production. We must consider all energy options available to lift us out of this dire crisis.
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"When Biden took over and they said 'we’re gonna put the fossil fuel industry out of business,' that started changing the mid and long-term plans of folks in the business. They weren’t gonna push ahead on leases knowing the White House was working against them."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Republicans are going along with more wasteful government spending while Americans pay the price for D.C.’s dysfunction with record high inflation. I’m voting no on this debt bomb, and anybody who claims to care about inflation should too."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Energy prices were already skyrocketing due to Biden’s disinvestment in domestic oil production. Restore American energy independence! 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,A new report by  showed that I'm at the top of the list for most bills passed into law this session of Congress - more than any other Republican. Read more about my three solutions signed into law last year for Hoosiers:  
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"I’m glad  has finally come around to shutting down Russian imports, but gas prices were going up before this invasion because Biden admin strangled American energy. Replace Russian oil &amp; gas with energy made in the USA - not Venezuela, not Iran, not Saudi Arabia - AMERICA."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Next stop on my  ➡️ Brown County High School! The Eagle Manufacturing program offers a range of career-based learning experiences to train Indiana’s next generation of skilled workers in Brown County and across the Hoosier state. Thanks for having me! 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Restore American energy independence! 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Today I voted to end the federal COVID state of emergency. It’s long past time for  to give up the extra powers he’s been given under this public health emergency declaration, so we can move forward rather than extending this emergency status indefinitely."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"The U.S. must become energy independent again, but the President has yet to make this a priority. When is he going to start putting America first?"
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"America is once again dependent on foreign oil to meet our everyday needs, and Russia is getting rich from it. We must take measures like reopening the Keystone Pipeline and restore America’s energy independence.  "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,We need energy independence again. 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,The same frontline workers who were hailed as heroes and served their fellow Americans during the pandemic were given a choice under Biden's vaccine mandate: your career or a vaccine It’s no surprise that the rate of health workers leaving their jobs is at a 20 year high. 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,President Biden shut down the Keystone pipeline and doubled our imports of Russian crude oil. We need American energy independence again. 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"America demands a secure border, and President Biden tried to undo everything that was working to keep our border safe. Secure the border! "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"President Biden tapped  Harris to lead our response to the southern border crisis nearly a year ago. Since then, she has never visited the border, and illegal crossings hit an all-time high. It’s time to pick someone who will actually do the job. "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"We need solutions on the high cost of healthcare, and we’re not going to get it from more Obamacare. We need to give the American people more power, not the federal government. "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"Two months ago, President Biden was trying to fire millions of Americans for their decision not to get vaccinated. If the Supreme Court hadn’t struck down his illegal rule, Americans would still be losing their jobs to federal mandates. "
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,A “fix” for inflation that involves hundreds of billions more deficit spending will not fix inflation. 
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Even liberal economists like the Obama White House’s Larry Summers warned that Biden’s big spending spree (the so-called “American Rescue Plan”) would set off inflation. We are lucky so much of this reckless economic agenda failed.
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"If you noticed President Biden isn’t wearing a mask tonight, it’s not because the science changed. It’s because the political science changed."
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"As you watch hundreds packed together in the U.S. Capitol tonight, remember that regular Americans are still banned from this building due to vague COVID restrictions. Lobbyists with connections in Congress are still coming in, though. Open the Capitol to the American people!"
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,Speaker Pelosi built a wall around the Capitol building tonight to secure Congress for the . We need to build one on our southern border to secure America.
Braun,SenatorBraun,right,"I can’t think of a record that would be harder to spin than President Biden’s one year in. From shutting down the Keystone pipeline, reckless spending, and projecting weakness on the world stage, the American people are paying the price for these failures. We need real solutions."

McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,The worst inflation in 40 years is fleecing American consumers from the gas pump to the grocery store. Democrats’ policies have prices rising faster than wages. The American people know one month of war in Europe doesn't explain 12 months of rising inflation on Democrats' watch.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,I have total confidence in Justice Thomas’s impartiality in every aspect of the work of the Court.  Each of the nine justices should feel free to make every single judicial decision they make with total independence and complete freedom.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Judicial independence is essential to our Republic and integral to the rule of law. The far left’s latest attack, a clumsy and baseless attempt to nullify Justice Thomas’s presence on the Court, is beyond the pale."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Democrats’ massive inflation is hammering working families. It’s badly hurt our entire economy.But President Biden just proposed a new budget that would dramatically increase liberal spending and slap the biggest tax hikes on American history on top.They just do not get it.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"President Biden's budget reinforces the disconnect between this Administration’s far-left goals and what Americans need. It’s soft on the defense funding we need to outpace Russia and China, heavy on left-wing waste and historic tax hikes."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"I went into the Senate’s consideration of Judge Jackson’s nomination with an open mind. But after studying the nominee’s record and watching her performance this week, I cannot and will not support Judge Jackson for a lifetime appointment to our highest Court."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,I was grieved to learn that our nation has lost former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. My prayers are with Secretary Albright’s family and all who mourn her loss. My full statement: 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Judge Jackson tried to deflect on key questions by telling Senators that constitutional issues haven’t come up often during her judicial service. Does she actually feel unprepared? If so, she shouldn't be confirmed. If not, then she owes the Senate much more clarity and candor. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Justices Ginsburg and Breyer had no problem defending the Court and slamming the door on partisan court-packing. Judge Jackson won't follow their lead. She carefully keeps that door open and avoids answering the Committee plainly. I’m afraid that speaks volumes. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"The late Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer both publicly opposed court-packing during their tenures. This week, Judge Jackson will be asked if she shares their view on upholding the integrity of the Court. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"I was saddened to learn that Cpl. Jacob Moore of Catlettsburg, Kentucky, was one of four Marines killed during NATO exercises in Norway Friday night. I am incredibly grateful for his service defending our nation’s freedom. My prayers are with his family in this difficult time."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Tune in now to . I’m joining  to discuss urgent support for Ukraine and the upcoming Supreme Court nomination hearing.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Justice Breyer, like the late Justice Ginsburg, is a staunch defender of the Court’s legitimacy and an opponent of far left court-packing plans. This should not be a hard question for his potential replacement. The Senate and the country deserve a clear answer from Judge Jackson. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,President Biden needs to step up his game on aid for Ukraine. Their resistance needs more lethal weapon systems that go after not only helicopters but higher-flying planes. We ought to be facilitating this aid right now. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Tune in now to . I’m joining  to discuss urgent support for Ukraine and the upcoming Supreme Court nomination hearings.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,President Zelensky and the people of Ukraine are showing the world incredible bravery and resilience. America cannot stay behind the curve. We must urgently get Ukraine more overdue lethal aid and air defense systems so they can keep up their fight for sovereignty and freedom.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Nobody buys Democrats’ efforts to blame 14 months of failed policies on three weeks of crisis in Europe. Inflation and gas prices were skyrocketing and hurting families long before late last month. The White House needs to stop trying to deny their mistakes and start fixing them. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,I strongly support America stopping purchasing Putin's oil.We must also recognize that the past year of bad policies from this anti-domestic-energy Administration will make this necessary step more painful than it had to be. Democrats must let Americans produce American energy.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,I enjoyed meeting Judge Jackson. One crucial Supreme Court qualification is judicial philosophy. The nation needs Justices who uphold the rule of law by applying our laws and Constitution as written. I’ll be studying the Judge’s record and views during the vigorous process ahead.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Tune in now to the . We’ll be discussing energy independence, the Supreme Court, and President Biden’s missed opportunity at the State of the Union last night. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"A year ago, President Biden hurt American energy independence on Day One by executive order. With another stroke of the pen, he could get us back in the production business to meet our own needs and export to our friends in Europe too. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Tune in now to . I’m joining  and  in studio to discuss President Biden's failure to pivot in his State of Union, 's excellent response, Ukraine, and the Supreme Court."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,". has done a great job leading with common sense through the pandemic. She’s backed the blue, faced down Big Labor to open schools, and fought for parents.Outstanding speech. After a warmed-over D.C. laundry list, Americans got to hear straight talk &amp; real solutions."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"President Biden ignored that his agenda has completely flopped for American families: Raging inflation, open borders, crime. The President did his best to try to pick himself up and provide some level of optimism but that’s not what the American people are feeling right now."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Tune in now to . I’m joining  to discuss tonight’s State of the Union and Ukraine.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,I’m glad the Americans will hear from  this evening. She’s a strong leader who delivers real solutions for the great people of Iowa. I look forward to hearing her reaction to the President’s remarks and her thoughts on how Washington could better serve Middle America.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"The President’s job is to seriously meet the growing threats posed by Russia and China. That starts with investing in our national defense. Our adversaries have prioritized military modernization for decades. We need more investment, not less, to strengthen our own capabilities."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"When Senator Jim Inhofe retires, the Senate will lose one of its foremost experts on defense policy, and Oklahoma will lose one of its fiercest advocates. I am glad our friend will continue to serve with us through the end of this Congress. My full statement: "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"The Senate must conduct a rigorous, exhaustive review of Judge Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court. This is especially crucial as Americans families face major crises that connect directly to our legal system, such as skyrocketing violent crime and open borders."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,I look forward to meeting with Judge Jackson in person and carefully reviewing her nomination during the vigorous and thorough Senate process that the American people deserve. My full statement: 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Putin’s initial aggression was just a small foretaste of what this thug had planned for Ukraine. America’s response will be measured carefully by our friends, by our adversaries, and by history itself. We cannot afford to fail this test. My full statement: "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"While Washington Democrats fail working Americans, Republican governors are fighting and winning for families. I am thrilled the American people will hear directly from Governor Kim Reynolds of Iowa in the Republican address to the nation. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Putin has turned his back on diplomacy in favor of escalation and the invasion of a sovereign country. The world is watching for America’s response. My full statement: 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"If Democrats actually wanted to help the American people afford gas, they wouldn’t have spent an entire year waging on American energy.In one year under President Biden, America went from being a net oil exporter to setting a new record high in oil imports from Russia."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Less than 48 hours after a far-left Black Lives Matter activist tried to literally murder a politician, the radical left bailed their comrade out of jail. It is just jaw-dropping. The innocent people of Louisville deserve better."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Needless school closures. Unscientific child mask mandates. A woke war against merit-based schools and standards.The far left even opposes basic K-12 transparency. They want parents sidelined and silenced.Republicans stand with families. The party of parents has your back.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,American families are facing the worst inflation in 40 years. The middle 40% of earners have seen their disposable incomes shrink. The Democrats who supercharged inflation want working people to trust their political spin over their own pocketbooks. But Americans know better.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,70% of Americans agree the virus is here to stay &amp; it's time for normalcy. Science tells us kids are at the lowest risk. Classrooms should have been the first places that politicians let get back to normal. But too many Democrat-controlled areas are putting kids and parents last.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Americans who watched the Super Bowl saw rich celebrities having a grand time with hardly a mask in sight. But under many Democrats’ policies, K-12 students who watched that big maskless party on TV last night had to wake up this morning and cover their own faces to go to school."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Tolerating lawlessness and anarchy is not compassionate. It doesn’t help vulnerable communities for politicians to passively watch them devolve into war zones. Democrats need to drop the soft-on-crime nonsense and give American families the protection they deserve. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"This all-Democrat government was warned their radical agenda would supercharge inflation and they pushed ahead anyway. Now, rampant inflation and soaring prices are crushing the American people."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,It is not compassionate to let vulnerable kids grow up in war zones because Democrats feel guilty putting violent criminals behind bars where they belong. Law-abiding citizens across America shouldn't live in fear because liberal public servants won’t do their jobs.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Innocent Americans across the country are becoming victims of a violent crime wave. My hometown Louisville set a new all-time murder record last year and averages a carjacking every 42 hours. Democrats have got to quit the radical anti-police rhetoric and soft-on-crime policies.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"American workers have been earning pay raises, but the Democrats’ inflation is more than outpacing them. Factoring in inflation, the average American worker has gotten a 2% real pay cut under Democrats’ policies."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Working families can’t afford a Federal Reserve Vice Chair who is itching to raise gas prices, raise energy and heating costs, reduce our energy independence, bankrupt entire industries, and misuse the Fed’s power to kill jobs in Middle America."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"The Federal Reserve is supposed to safeguard the American dollar, not enforce a radical agenda the far left can’t get through Congress. But President Biden’s nominee for the number two spot wants our central bank to act like a ‘woke’ super-legislature where citizens get no say."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Two years into COVID, with the current facts &amp; science, citizens deserve a clear, quick off-ramp back towards normal.Leaders must trust science &amp; vaccines, ditch moving goalposts &amp; unpopular mandates, lead with facts not fear, explain risks have plummeted, and promote normalcy."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Democrats' reckless spending has fueled the worst inflation in 40 years. Families are hurting — at the checkout counter, at the gas pump, when they pay their bills. Exactly what bipartisan experts warned would happen if they rammed through their reckless far-left spending."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Kentuckians are resilient. But many are still reeling from the catastrophic tornadoes that hammered Kentucky in mid-December. It’s a long road to recovery, but my office and I are helping Kentuckians every step of the way. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,I congratulate Justice Breyer on nearly three decades of thoughtful and consequential service on the Supreme Court. My full statement following his announcement today: 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Today, on the 77th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, we commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day. We must never forget the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust and always confront antisemitism wherever it takes root."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"A warm welcome to the Kentuckians and all Americans who are Marching for Life on a cold day in Washington. Thank you for courageously witnessing to the dignity of every single human life, especially the most vulnerable. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Tune in now to . I am joining  to discuss President Biden’s first year in office and Democrats' failed attempt to destroy the Senate.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"President Biden took office one year ago.He's presided over the worst inflation in 40 years. Historic spikes in murders &amp; illegal border crossings. COVID surges, school closures, &amp; illegal mandates. A failed, fatal retreat from Afghanistan. And far-left attacks on institutions. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Tonight, nearly every Senate Democrat wrote in permanent ink that they would shatter the soul of the Senate for short-term power. Fortunately, a bipartisan majority saved the Senate and ensured that millions and millions of Americans’ voices will not be silenced."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Democrats' election takeover bill is not a response to any state law. It is a sweeping, radical power grab that they first drafted in 2019.Bureaucrats would get new power to police citizens' online speech. The federal government would start directly funding political campaigns."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,The left's fake panic over voting is collapsing. Less than 0.5% of Americans say this is a top priority. Even the media is pointing out that Georgia’s law is more open than Delaware or New York. And more citizens say voting laws are too loose than say they are too restrictive.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"One year after Pres. Biden promised to heal &amp; unite America, top Democrats are trying to use fear &amp; anger to smash the Senate. They want to silence millions of Americans' voices and strip entire states of any say in government. All to set up a partisan rewrite of election law."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Last week, the same Democrats who’ve been raging against the Senate’s 60-vote threshold used the 60-vote threshold to block Russia sanctions.Today, they’re back to saying it’s an evil rule.They've quit even pretending this is principled. They just want total one-party power."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Nearly 60 years since the March on Washington, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s message echoes as powerfully as it did that day. His legacy inspires us to celebrate and keep building upon the remarkable progress our great nation has made toward becoming a more perfect union."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"The Framers built the Senate to protect against exactly the sort of inaccurate, irresponsible bullying which the President shouted at the country yesterday.His reckless speech was the perfect case study for the importance of the Senate and its rules. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"The current Democratic Leader wants power so badly he's willing to misrepresent his own late predecessor if it helps him get it. Senator Byrd went out of his way to argue against rule-breaking power grabs and protect the Senate’s most central feature, the legislative filibuster. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Washington Democrats’ political agenda is on the rocks, so they’ve set their sights on a new prize: A complete, partisan takeover of the Senate, elections, and America. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"If Democrats blow up Senate rules, millions of Americans will cease to have a voice in the Senate. Entire states would be shut out.Top Dems have floated breaking the rules for years now. This isn't about new voting laws. It's about silencing voters who inconvenience Democrats."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,No party that would break the Senate can be trusted to seize unprecedented control over all 50 states’ election laws.The fact that many Democrats are this desperate for a one-party takeover of our democracy proves exactly why they cannot be allowed to do it.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Harry Reid was a dedicated public servant and a truly one-of-a-kind U.S Senator. My full statement: 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"The beauty of Christmas brings light and warmth to the coldest and darkest time of year. This year, let’s hold in our thoughts our fellow Kentuckians and Americans who won’t be enjoying their normal holiday. I hope this holiday brings you health and happiness. Merry Christmas. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Democrats spent 2021 distracted with unrelated far-left ambitions. As a result, the Biden Administration has America badly short on affordable COVID tests, new treatments, or any actual plan.Angry speeches about inherited vaccines are not a strategy.My full statement: "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Tune in now to . I’m joining Larry Kudlow to discuss Washington Democrats’ efforts to try inflating their way out of inflation and grab partisan power over all 50 states’ elections.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Tune in now to . I’m joining  and  to discuss Democrats’ efforts to ram through a multi-trillion-dollar reckless taxing and spending spree.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,The Senate was designed to make it difficult to have radical change in the country unless there are huge majorities on one side or the other. The filibuster prevents extremism. Democrats want to eliminate it so they can fundamentally change the structure of America forever. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Tune in now to . I’ll be discussing Democrats’ failed agenda and what’s next for the Senate in 2022. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,I said the single biggest favor Democrats could do for the country is to abandon their reckless taxing and spending spree. It’s absolutely inappropriate at a time when we’re already fighting inflation. The American people need this bad idea to stay buried. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Tune in now to the . We’ll be discussing the latest on Democrats’ reckless taxing and spending spree and their efforts to ram through a partisan Washington takeover of elections in all 50 states. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Elaine and I are extremely sad to learn of the passing of our dear friend, Johnny Isakson. Today, we are united with Johnny’s family in their grief. My full statement: "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,The single biggest Christmas present Washington Democrats could give to the American people is to kill their reckless taxing and spending spree. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"The big story of the year is the worst inflation in almost 40yrs. It is a tax on Americans. Families have had to spend $3,500 more than they did last year just to tread water. It is directly attributable to Democrats' multi-trillion-dollar inflationary spending earlier this year. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Senate Democrats may not get to spend trillions more inflationary dollars before Christmas after all. So for a sideshow, they’ve switched back to misinformation about voting laws.They want to break Senate rules to seize partisan power over all 50 states’ elections."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,My team and I are working hard to connect Kentuckians with the resources they need to recover.Our new portal has a full list of services provided by our disaster response agencies:
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Tornadoes devastated Kentucky this past weekend. Thousands have lost their homes. More than 60 Kentuckians are confirmed dead. Our Commonwealth has suffered its worst storm in generations. But Kentucky is resilient and we are united. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Thank you  for your rapid approval of Kentucky’s Major Disaster Declaration. Our entire congressional delegation came together to support ’s request. I appreciate the Administration’s quick work to speed resources to help deal with this crisis. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"It is devastating to hear that so many Kentuckians have died from last night's tornado disaster. I have spoken with , , , and  and am working with Kentucky’s local, state, and federal leaders to deliver rapid federal assistance."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,I am praying for the lives lost and communities impacted by the tornado devastation throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Thank you to our brave first responders. I will work to aid our communities with the federal funding and resources they need to rebuild. My full statement: 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,6.8% inflation is the worst in almost 40 years. It is unthinkable that Senate Democrats would try to respond to this inflation report by ramming through another massive socialist spending package in a matter of days. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"The real engine behind Robert Dole's 98 remarkable years was his love. His love for Elizabeth and Robin, for public service, for Kansas, and for America. Today we honor the amazing life that love created. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Eighty years ago today, America was thrust into a fight we did not choose. But we resolved to win it, starting with the valor and bravery that so many demonstrated at Pearl Harbor that very day. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"The whole country stands with the Dole family — not only in grief, but in gladness and thanksgiving for almost a century that was lived so patriotically, so gratefully, and so well. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"I strongly condemn the sham trial and the sham sentence that Burma’s illegitimate, unelected military junta has imposed on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. My full statement: "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Bob Dole lived the kind of full, rich, and deeply honorable American life that will be impossible for any tribute today to fully capture. As we mourn this most distinguished American son, we send our sincerest condolences to the entire Dole family. My full statement: "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"For Christmas, the single biggest gift Washington Democrats could give to the American people is to kill this multi-trillion-dollar reckless taxing and spending bill. The last thing this country needs is more inflationary spending. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Tune in now to . I am joining  and  to discuss Democrats' absurd attempt to inflate their way out of inflation with a multi-trillion-dollar reckless taxing and spending spree.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Inflation is hammering working families from coast to coast, but Democrats want to print, borrow, and spend trillions more.Our economy is already sputtering on their watch, but Democrats want to wallop the country with massive tax hikes that would kill American jobs."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,The single best thing we can do to fight inflation is to kill Democrats' multi-trillion-dollar reckless taxing and spending spree. Not a single Republican is going to vote for it. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Nine in ten Americans are worried about inflation.President Biden promised to unite the country and it turns out he has. Families across the country are united in fear and frustration at the runaway prices and supply chain shortages that Democrats’ policies have helped unleash.
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"President Biden promised Americans his reckless taxing and spending spree would cost $0. It's not true. The CBO says it will add $800 billion to the deficit in the next 5 years. Even if you accept all their budget gimmicks, it still doesn’t come close to balancing after a decade."
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Americans are once again coming together to break bread and count the blessings we are fortunate to call our own. I’m thinking especially of our brave servicemen and women who protect our country and our freedoms. I hope you and your family have a Happy Thanksgiving. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"90% of Americans are worried about inflation, but House Democrats just voted to let Washington D.C. print, borrow, and waste trillions more. My full statement on House Democrats walking the plank for the far left's reckless taxing and spending spree: "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,"Tune now to the . We’ll be discussing Democrats' inflationary spending spree and all the ways the massive, reckless bill they’re putting together would hurt American families and Build Back Beijing. "
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,Many Americans including many Kentuckians depend on natural gas to heat their homes. They are staring down the barrel of skyrocketing bills this winter. The Democrats’ reckless spending spree would go to war against affordable American energy at the worst possible time. 
McConnell,LeaderMcConnell,center,There is no uncertainty about what the number one issue is among Americans: It's inflation. 90% of Americans are concerned about inflation. But Democrats want to ignore the people and spend trillions more. Americans can not afford another massive dose of socialism.

Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,We need to stop placing burdens on companies that are trying to go green in good faith. The SEC’s disclosure decision is problematic. 📰 Read my op-ed here: 
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"According to a recent Fox News poll, 53% of registered voters said that Biden's administration has made the economy worse and 67% blamed them for current gas prices. Do you agree?"
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"With a new Operation Warp Speed, we can create new American jobs and quickly produce new energy sources. Watch my interview here 📺 "

Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,Did you miss this? Read my thoughts on today's issues below:
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,OUTRAGE of the week: the Biden administration tried to blame high gas prices on Putin's war. Watch the video for the truth 📺 
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,As long as we depend on other countries for energy we run security risks.We need Energy Operation Warp Speed.
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"We need operation energy warp speed now. This isn't right, Americans shouldn't be paying the price for this administration’s failed energy policies."
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,Biden is trying to shift blame to Russia for rising gas prices but rapidly rising inflation and gas prices have been ongoing issues since he took office.
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,America must lead the way on a Russia-Free energy future. It's time for Energy Operation Warp Speed.
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,We need an Operation Warp Speed for American energy production.📺 Watch my full interview on Cavuto: Coast to Coast below: 
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"This is a step in the right direction, but Biden must also re-start the Keystone pipeline and put Americans to work producing energy Here in the U.S."
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,Americans overwhelmingly want Biden to STEP UP his weak foreign policy. Sanctions must include Russian oil. 
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,Putin is unable to explain his illegal war to his own people. Putin is a war criminal and should be treated as one. 
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,Biden wants to fund his transition plan to green energy with your wallet. Don't tread on American families. 
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"This is a great step in the right direction, and I agree, we need to help the Ukrainian people. But the Biden Administration's sanctions must be stronger as well. "
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,Biden's address missed the core point. Biden has failed to create ANY actionable plans to combat the problems facing Americans today. 
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"In tonight's State of the Union address, Biden will brag about his accomplishments, but Americans know he is taking our country in the wrong direction."
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"Once again, oblivious John Kerry misses the mark. "
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,High-speed internet is critical to bettering the lives of families across Louisiana. $29.9 Million has been granted to increase broadband capabilities. More money is coming later this year. This is a first step towards ensuring that every family has access to high-speed internet.
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,Hurricane Ida devastated Louisiana communities last year. Our first responders were critical to saving lives. I’m happy to announce that $5.4 Million will be sent to Louisiana first responders to improve their ability to do their job. Preparedness is critical to saving lives.
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"The Biden admin’s current sanctions are only half measures. We need to do more on sanctions to hurt Putin’s pockets if we want to better support Ukraine. To better understand what I mean, you should watch my interview: "
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,Putin has turned Russia into a pariah state. Everything short of involving U.S. forces should be done to punish Russia for this disgusting &amp; terrible action. Our pressure should be unrelenting.
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"Although it has been years since Hurricanes Katrina &amp; Laura devastated Louisiana, our communities still feel their impact everyday. FEMA’s new $10.7 Million grant will help Louisiana communities continue to both recover from these storms and prepare for future natural disasters."
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,Inflation continues to rise &amp; the Biden Admin does nothing to address it. The American people should not continue to be punished because of bad policy choices. This crisis must be fixed.

Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,Outrage of the Week: Biden sacrificed the prosperity of thousands of American workers &amp; endangered our energy security when he canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. Biden refuses to face accountability for the jobs that were lost. That's why there's still no report. 
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,My colleagues and I asked the Biden admin to send over a report on the thousands of jobs lost when they canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. Feb 13 was the deadline and there's no report. Hard working Americans would have benefitted from these jobs. We NEED accountability.

Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"In 2021, Biden’s spending gave $1 Billion in stimulus payments to prison inmates. Even the Boston Marathon Bomber, a terrorist, got paid. I introduced an amendment to stop this but EVERY Senate Democrat voted NO. This is why we MUST retake the Senate. "
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"Thanks to the policies of the Biden admin, in 1 year, our country has gone from energy independent to begging at the feet of OPEC to alleviate our self-made energy crisis. This threatens our security. No matter how Democrats try &amp; frame it, that is this Admin's legacy."
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"Outrage of the Week: Did Biden promise inflation during his inauguration? Because high inflation seems to be a policy priority of his admin. From unnecessary spending, to the starving of our energy resources, our nation has become weaker in the past year. It’s time for a change. "
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"As a strong Conservative, committed Doctor &amp; Senator, I want to put the American people FIRST. Biden's Policies do just the opposite. They’ve created a strain on America's economy &amp; safety. We must take back the Senate &amp; restore Conservative values once again."
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"The views of the Administration's Federal Reserve nominee on the oil &amp; gas industry are dangerous not only for workers in my state of LA, but our national security. Using the power of the central bank to carry out an agenda &amp; destroy our industry is not what this country needs."
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,"Outrage of the Week: Democrat DA's in NY, PA, &amp; WI are releasing violent criminals who then go on to commit more crimes and take the lives of innocent civilians. We must keep DA's accountable for their nonsense soft on crime policies. "
Cassidy,BillCassidy,right,The pressure placed on students to decide where they will attend college is tremendous. I introduced the College Transparency Act to help give students &amp; parents all the key facts they need to decide what school is right for them.

Klobuchar,amyklobuchar,left,"Excited to say that this last week a lot of great legislation I’ve championed got signed into law! A bill to protect seniors from scams. The Abby Honold Act, which, thanks to her activism, will help protect survivors of sexual assault. And a law to boost tourism!"
Klobuchar,amyklobuchar,left,"Almost 90,000 Minnesotans called on Congress this week to lower prescription prices. Well, I couldn't agree more. 20% of older adults have reported not taking needed medications because it costs too much. That is appalling. We have the legislation; it's time for a vote!"
Klobuchar,amyklobuchar,left,"Kharkiv, Ukraine destruction at the hands of pure evil. Kindergarten class. Destroyed. Mall. Destroyed. Apartment building. Destroyed. Town square. Destroyed.The spirit and strength of the Ukrainian people. Will never be destroyed. 🇺🇦"

Klobuchar,amyklobuchar,left,"The budget we passed had some huge wins for Minnesota. Our state is getting millions for public safety, for water infrastructure, and for important projects like improving health care and child care access. It’s going to change lives!"
Klobuchar,amyklobuchar,left,It’s been a tough couple of years for tourism. Our bill to make sure  has the resources to keep promoting travel and tourism has been signed into law! Another bipartisan win with Senator Blunt! 
Klobuchar,amyklobuchar,left,Out-of-pocket insulin costs should be capped at $35. Period.
Klobuchar,amyklobuchar,left,"Oil prices are down, but gas prices are still high. Big oil companies should not be raking in huge profits while Americans struggle. That’s not how this should work. One way to break this cycle is investing in homegrown biofuels. I’ve got a bipartisan bill. Let’s get it done."
Klobuchar,amyklobuchar,left,Jim Hill grew up in Minnesota. His friends knew Jim as a dreamer and a helper — a good person gone too soon. Putin’s senseless war is resulting in so much needless tragedy. My deepest sympathies go out to Jim’s family and loved ones.
Klobuchar,amyklobuchar,left,"This week alone, we lost three journalists in Ukraine. Brent Renaud, Pierre Zakrzewski, and Oleksandra Kuvshinova were killed documenting the atrocities happening there. Unacceptable and heartbreaking. My thoughts are with their families."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"States are taking aggressive action in the expectation that Roe will be gutted. Some are making sure people will still have access to reproductive care; others, the exact opposite. We are already seeing what a post-Roe world might look like. "
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,I'm proud to support Judge Jackson's nomination—and glad she's getting bipartisan support.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,A wonderful chat with our next Supreme Court Justice.

Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Mental health care is health care and everyone should have access to it.Today I toured the Southeast Regional Crisis Center — which just opened last July — to learn about the critical care they provide to a 10-county region and how they're meeting the needs of so many people. 
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,I just toured two sites in Rochester that could benefit from the Infrastructure Law.An interchange at HWY 14/HWY 44 would fix the dangerous intersection to make it safer for people to commute and Olmsted's Waste-to-Energy Facility is doing incredible work on renewable energy. 
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,We are seeing yet another month of historic job growth. The unemployment rate is down to 3.6%. The American Rescue Plan is working and momentum is strong. It’s time for the Republicans to work with us and help us lower prices for families across this country.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,This is correct. We need to support efforts to vaccinate abroad so we can fight the pandemic at home. COVID doesn’t care about borders. 
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"American families face $88 billion in medical debt. And we know low-income individuals, Black and Hispanic households, young adults, and older Americans are most likely to be affected. I'm urging the  to take action to address unfair medical debt collection practices."

Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,I support capping insulin costs at $35 a month—and am pushing to make sure that people without insurance can get the medication too.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,You know what actually delegitimizes the Court? Stealing two seats. 
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"In the four months since the Texas ban went into effect, there was a 1000% increase in women seeking abortions out of state.Many states are restricting reproductive freedom. Neighboring states are trying to compensate. The assault on Roe is already here. "
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"LGBTQ+ youth should be supported and uplifted, not feel they need to hide who they are. Florida’s law is cruel, hateful, and just plain wrong."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"Great to see this from Civica RX after my bill to approve lower cost insulin options was signed into law. We have a long way to go to make insulin affordable for all, but this is an important step forward."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Great news. 
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"These companies want to pretend that they run like any other business, but they do not. And they are trying to pretend they are the solution to lower gas prices. Color me skeptical."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Here is something a lot of people don't know: the government has been giving oil and gas companies billions in tax breaks for over 100 years. Also those same companies put huge amounts of money in stock buybacks. IE: Giving payouts to investors.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Thanks so much to  for stopping by my office and talking about the value of mentoring students. It was so great meeting you all. 
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"Four teams, four paths to the frozen 4, four Minnesotan teams in the running. We got this."

Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,May her memory be a blessing.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"I’m very sad to hear of the passing of Madeleine Albright. I got to know her through our shared friendship with Walter Mondale, first at a long and uproarious dinner. She was a great public servant and a funny, incisive observer of people both famous and infamous."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"It's National Agriculture Day. Agriculture provides us with our food, clothes, fuel, and so much more. Grateful for all of the producers and farmers in Minnesota today and everyday—thank you for all you do. "
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,The U.S. is the only industrialized country with an increasing maternal mortality rate—and it's particularly affecting rural areas and communities of color. My Rural MOMS Act that just signed into law will start to help fix this.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"Leaders in Minnesota led this push for Tribal justice. Advocates called my office, I pushed for changes, and now the ability of Tribes' to better prosecute sex crimes has been signed into law. "
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"So when Marsha Blackburn talks about an agenda of letting the government into our private family decisions, does she show any signs of appreciating the irony of that? Or the hypocrisy? Didn’t think so."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"In a breathtaking display of projection, Ted Cruz argues that Democrats want an anti-democratic SCOTUS that implements our preference through caselaw rather than by convincing the American public. Right."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"Last year, Americans saved $800 per person in health care premiums.The American Rescue Plan—which included significant assistance to help people of all incomes pay their premiums—is working."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"The obvious solution: get off this rollercoaster and switch to clean sources of energy. With clean, we don’t not need to worry about how global events are going to impact our fuel supply. No other country can tell us when the wind can blow or the sun can shine."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"A week ago, the oil industry was telling us to trust them to solve our energy problems. Now the price of oil is down and Americans are still being charged high prices anyway. If the oil industry wants to show us they are serious, they are doing a bad job."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,President Zelenskyy’s leadership in the face of Europe's worst crisis since WWII is inspiring the world. His address to Congress drove home the terrible violence and sacrifice that the brave people of Ukraine are making. We must stand united in support of Ukraine.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Today is Equal Pay Day. This marks how far into 2022 women must work to catch up to what men made in 2021. The gap is even worse for women of color.  The gender wage gap is real. It’s time to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,We are less than a year out from the Texas abortion ban and other states are starting to follow. Roe is under attack. We need to fight back. Expand the Supreme Court. 
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Sarah Bloom Raskin is twice confirmed by the US Senate and eminently qualified to serve on the Fed Board. It’s such a loss that she has withdrawn—and a sign of the continued undue power of the fossil fuel industry on Capitol Hill.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"Missouri, a state with one of the strictest abortion laws, now has a bill to ban residents from traveling across state lines for reproductive services. These attacks won't decrease the amount of abortions—they’ll decrease access to safe ones. "
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"This funding will go towards broadband expansion, river cleanups, public safety upgrades to affordable housing, and much more. Will be releasing more details soon."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Proud to announce that  and I have secured over 130 million dollars in federal funding for Minnesota projects in the budget bill.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Great piece by  showing the problem with exclusively talking about oil drilling. Focusing on fossil fuels is not a long-term solution for high gas prices. We have to build out clean energy sources so that the price of gas becomes irrelevant.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"Loved meeting with  and hearing about their experiences as college students. We discussed open textbooks, increasing Pell Grants and TRIO funding, and reauthorizing the Higher Ed Act. These are all priorities I share and will continue working toward. "
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"I passed a bill to help approve more low-cost insulin options.Now, Civica Rx, a nonprofit drug company, is making insulin that's no more than $30 per vial. We have a long way to go to make insulin affordable for all, but this is an important step forward."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"Over half of Native women experience sexual violence, and today, Tribes still need greater resources and authority to seek justice.My bill addresses this problem head on. And it’s now included in the omnibus budget bill. Survivors deserve justice."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"The way to stop countries like Russia controlling fossil fuel prices isn’t just to drill for more fossil fuels. The real, long term solution is to switch to clean energy sources so we never have to be at the mercy of other countries to get our energy."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"Even for Fox News, this is legitimately unbelievable. Tucker Carlson is just writing Putin’s propaganda for him at this point. "
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"This was predictable and shows why safe, available, and affordable abortion services are vital. If a law makes it impossible for women to get reproductive services, they will find other ways.As the attacks on Roe continue, this only becomes more common. "
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"For years, the Postal Service has been trying to eliminate Saturday delivery.  Today, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill that will permanently require six days a week of delivery so Minnesotans can get the mail they rely on.  Next stop: Biden's desk."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"If you already got your free COVID tests for your household, the Biden administration is now offering four more. Order another round of tests today—so you'll have them when you need them. "
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"There have been over 200 failed attempts to make lynching a federal crime since 1900. Last night, the Senate unanimously passed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act and it is now headed to Biden’s desk to be signed into law. This is long overdue. Proud to have supported this bill."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"This is exactly why clean energy is powerful. No country can tell us when the sun can shine or the wind can blow. If we want to be serious about energy independence, fossil fuels are not the path to freedom. Diversifying and shifting rapidly to clean energy is the way to go."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"The obvious solution here, if we don't want Putin to have a say in our energy prices, is to shift to energy that Putin can't control. Fortunately, we have some great options. Clean ones too."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"The goal is to not rely on places like Putin's Russia, so only focusing on oil and gas makes no sense. Russia has a lot of oil and gas, and those prices are set globally. So no matter what the U.S. does, Putin will always have a lot of control over how much fossil fuels cost."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"There's been a lot of talk about the need for energy independence. I agree. And the Biden team is moving to maximize U.S. fossil production in the near term. That is fine, but the way forward to true independence is getting energy from clean sources.Here's why. [Short Thread]"
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,A strong and necessary demonstration of leadership by President Biden. I support banning Russian oil. Let’s remember that Republicans also support the ban and called for this action.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Just got off a Zoom with President Zelensky and other members of Congress. Here is what I messaged him. 
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"As we continue to recover from the pandemic, we can't leave workers behind. It's time to get more Americans eligible for job-protected leave for medical and family circumstances.The Job Protections Act would do just that, and I'll keep pushing with  to pass it."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"Great news out of today’s job report. There were over 600,000 jobs added in just the last month and the unemployment rate is now down to 3.8%. The American Rescue Plan is working. I’m going to keep pushing in the Senate to pass serious legislation and keep up the momentum."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"It’s my birthday today. I’m turning 64, or as we like to call it in the Senate: middle-aged."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Welcome back my friend. 
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"An honor to welcome the President to Duluth today and talk infrastructure with  and . Stop by anytime Mr. President, you are always welcome in Minnesota. "
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"No other country can tell us when the sun can shine or the wind can blow. If the build-out of clean energy is not the very definition of energy independence, I don't know what is."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,President Biden is bringing the country together. He's marshaled the resources we need to get our economy growing.Looking forward to hearing his State of the Union address tonight.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,It's now been six months since Texas's abortion ban has been enacted. Roe is not just at risk in the future. It is currently being attacked and the effects have been devastating. I will always stand on the side of reproductive freedom.

Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"Providing advice and consent on Supreme Court nominations is one of my most important responsibilities as a United States Senator, and I look forward to meeting with Judge Jackson and reviewing her record."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"This is an exciting and historic nomination; if confirmed, she would be the first Black woman and first former federal public defender on the Supreme Court."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is exceptionally well-qualified to serve on the Supreme Court, and her demonstrated commitment to defending the constitutional and civil rights of all Americans makes her an outstanding choice of nominee."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,I commend the Biden administration for leading a unified front with our NATO allies to impose swift and severe sanctions that will dramatically weaken Russia’s economic and strategic positions.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"Russia must be held accountable for this blatant and illegal aggression, and I will continue to stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people as they defend their country."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, a sovereign democratic nation, is an affront to freedom and democracy around the world. Putin’s decision to launch this unjustified war will cause catastrophic loss of life and human suffering."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"Proposed clean energy tax credits would reduce electric bills by billions per year over the next decade. And over time, those savings would only increase. That's countless Americans with lower energy bills month after month. All we have to do is get it passed."
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,It’s a sad day to lose a strong woman leader of color in the Minnesota legislature with the departure of Senate Minority Leader Melisa López Franzen.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,It was so fun speaking to ninth grade civics classes at Apple Valley High School and sharing my history of public service with them. I enjoyed hearing what curiosities they had about our government and answering their thoughtful questions. 
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"A new study shows that getting vaccinated while pregnant could lower the baby's risk of becoming hospitalized with COVID-19 within the first 6 months of their life.The COVID vaccines are safe, free, and widely available. Get your shot today."

Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,It was great speaking at the Minnesota State Council of Machinists Spring Conference!I’m proud to stand by them by pushing for the PRO Act to strengthen workers’ rights. 
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Retail sales increased by 3.8 percent in January. This rebound is even faster than expected. Let's keep up the momentum—the American Rescue Plan is working.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Jim Hagedorn and I worked on opposite sides of the aisle but both worked to serve the people of Minnesota. No one should be taken away from us at such a young age. Thinking of Jennifer and all Jim’s family.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Looking forward to catching up soon my friend. Welcome back and best of wishes on the final part of the recovery. 
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Republican members of the Banking Committee who all skipped yesterday's hearing: take note. 
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,It’s kinda hard for me to take seriously all the Senate Republicans speechifying about inflation when they don't even show up for Committee votes on Fed nominees who are responsible for managing inflation.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"., I once finished up a big negotiation by literally locking everyone into the Governor’s Residence until it was done. Anyone know of a place? Maybe a Camp in the wilderness? "
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,Not a single Republican showed up to vote on Fed nominees — it’s almost like they don’t want to do anything about inflation.
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"As the economy continues to grow and spur job growth, it’s critical that we have a full Fed board that will put workers first. I’m supporting all five of President Biden’s highly qualified nominees for the Federal Reserve. "
Smith,SenTinaSmith,left,"HIV disproportionally impacts people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals, who often can't get the HIV prevention services they need. I'm working to ensure that no one has to pay for life-saving HIV prevention drugs, like the one mentioned in this article. "

Blunt,RoyBlunt,right,"Last year, Dems forced through a partisan, $1.9T spending bill when our economy was well on the way to recovery. Even liberal economists warned it would fuel inflation and it has, sticking Americans with higher costs on the things they need every day. "
Blunt,RoyBlunt,right,"While I will vote no on Judge Jackson’s confirmation, I believe her historic nomination is a proud moment for our country. More from my interview on  with : "
Blunt,RoyBlunt,right,"There is no doubt Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is well qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. However, her judicial philosophy is not one I can support."

Fischer,SenatorFischer,right,"Facing heroic Ukrainian resistance and growing US, NATO, EU unity to impose costs on Russia for his unjustified and unprovoked war, Putin is resorting to the unthinkable, nuclear intimidation.

Fischer,SenatorFischer,right,I expect to hear from  about a strategy to impose real costs on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
Fischer,SenatorFischer,right,"Putin has been clear on his goals: reestablish the former Soviet Union. This was an invasion of a sovereign nation. Biden must show firm resolve, work with our allies and immediately put in place strong sanctions."
Fischer,SenatorFischer,right,"Today, we honor the leadership and contributions that so many presidents have brought to our nation. Wishing all of Nebraska a Happy ! "

Sasse,SenSasse,right,President Biden kept his promise to the Taliban and lied to the American people. These lies will cost Americans for decades to come.

Sasse,SenSasse,right,"Mr. President, there is a clear choice before you now: Either rip up the August 31 deadline and defend evacuation routes — by expanding the perimeter around the Kabul airport or by retaking Bagram — or leave our people behind in your retreat. "
Sasse,SenSasse,right,It looks like the President and his team have a plan that is just to accept the risk that we will leave Americans behind. Leaving a single American behind is a disaster. It's a dereliction of duty. It's a national disgrace. 
Sasse,SenSasse,right,"Damn the deadline. The American people are not going to surrender our fellow citizens to the Taliban. Mr. President, tell the Taliban we’re getting our people out however long it takes, and that we’re perfectly willing to spill Taliban, al-Qaeda, and ISIS blood to do it. "
Sasse,SenSasse,right,A great nation keeps its word. This administration needs to go faster and save the Americans and Afghan allies behind enemy lines. 
Sasse,SenSasse,right,The Taliban needs to know they don't dictate the timetable on American lives. 
Sasse,SenSasse,right,President Biden: We cannot wait for Americans to find their own way. Go get them. It’s the duty of the commander-in-chief. 
Sasse,SenSasse,right,There can be no countdown clock on American lives.

Sasse,SenSasse,right,Every American who cares about the rule of law should take comfort that the Supreme Court — including all three of President Trump’s picks — closed the book on the nonsense. 
Sasse,SenSasse,right,"The task for this year is to finish the job by the book: Ignore overheated rhetoric, let state and local officials complete the count, and trust in the rule of law."
Sasse,SenSasse,right,"Actually, “originalism” is another way of saying that texts and words have meaning. That's not to claim that all texts and words from 1789 were correct – but that when they need to be changed, they should be changed by elected legislators, not unelected judges."

Portman,senrobportman,center,We also must tighten sanctions on Russia – on energy sales that fuel the Russian war machine &amp; on Russia's finance and defense industry. We must revoke international tax and trade agreements. If we can close the loopholes in our sanctions we can bleed their war chest dry.

Portman,senrobportman,center,Title 42 works for now but it also can’t be the permanent solution since it is a public health authority. The Biden admin must put in place policies that reform the current asylum system to reduce the pull factors that brings migrants to the US unlawfully.
Portman,senrobportman,center,We can’t handle the current wave of individuals coming to the border &amp; the info we’ve received from  shows that human smugglers are already advertising the end of Title 42 which will lead to a massive increase in migrants.

Portman,senrobportman,center,Overdose deaths in this country have reached a record high – we can combat this surge by doing everything we can to increase access to treatment for individuals with substance use disorders.
Portman,senrobportman,center,"In March 2020, in-person examination requirements were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing providers to prescribe MAT and other necessary drugs via telehealth.

Portman,senrobportman,center,"The US welcomes legal immigrants &amp; always should. They enrich our country but it's vital that they come legally. The Biden admin must fix this broken system, reform the asylum process, &amp; stop these policies that send a green light to the human smugglers and drug traffickers."
Portman,senrobportman,center,"I’m frustrated with the reports that  plans to bring more buses, planes, &amp; personnel to the border to process unlawful migrants into the country more quickly when Title 42 ends. This policy change will only increase the worst migration crisis in our nation’s history."
Portman,senrobportman,center,"As I’ve said many times before, in order to address the worst migrant crisis our nation has ever seen, the Biden admin must reform the asylum process that acts as a pull factor to bring unlawful migrants to our southern border. "

Portman,senrobportman,center,"Russia’s invasion highlights the importance of the US having an all-of-the-above energy approach to power our nation, including fossil fuels, renewables, carbon capture, nuclear power &amp; hydrogen. The admin must reverse course – their actions must support our commitments to Europe"
Portman,senrobportman,center,"I am disappointed with the president's tax proposals in his FY 2023 budget request, which eliminate tax provisions used to encourage more American energy production. This shortsightedness will discourage domestic energy production &amp; undermine our efforts to help our EU allies."
Portman,senrobportman,center,Europe must also cut off its dependency on Russian energy &amp; the U.S. must help backfill their energy needs –something  announced we will do. To do that we must increase our production here at home &amp; develop the infrastructure to get our energy to market.
Portman,senrobportman,center,"Over the past year, the average oil revenues for Russia from their exports to the U.S. alone were about $50 million a day. Under pressure from Congress, the Biden admin finally agreed to stop buying Russian oil."

Portman,senrobportman,center,"Glad to see almost $3 billion in federal grants announced thanks to my bipartisan infrastructure law to improve our bridges, roads, ports, and more. This is good news for Ohio, where we have lots of core infrastructure needs."
Portman,senrobportman,center,Time for all of our NATO colleagues to join the United States and others in transitioning away from the purchase of Russian oil and gas. We must cut off all funding of Russia’s war machine.
Portman,senrobportman,center,"Access to our U.S. market is a privilege, not a right, and we should not give Russians the normal access. The House passed a law to suspend what's called Most Favored Nation status or PNTR for Russia, it’s time for the Senate to do the same."
Portman,senrobportman,center,"I enjoyed the opportunity to talk about the most pressing issues facing our nation, especially the work we’re doing in Congress to support the Ukrainian people."

Portman,senrobportman,center,It is past time for the Biden admin to reverse course and support our domestic energy producers.
Portman,senrobportman,center,"Joined my fellow Republican colleagues yesterday to discuss the increasing gas prices &amp; rising inflation across our country. While the Biden admin blames Russia for the increases, it is clear that their own policies have stifled domestic energy production &amp; led to soaring prices. "
Portman,senrobportman,center,Glad to see the Biden administration has made the formal determination. These crimes will not go unpunished. 
Portman,senrobportman,center,"I have said since the start of this war against  that Russian atrocities of deliberately bombing maternity wards, targeting civilians and using cluster bombs are war crimes."

Portman,senrobportman,center,"5th, and maybe most important, we need to lead our European allies on fully sanctioning Russia’s energy sector. Russia’s war machine is funded primarily though energy sales – including natural gas and oil – to Europe."
Portman,senrobportman,center,"The  should reclassify Russia as a non-market economy country, especially since up to 70 percent of their economy is run by the government."
Portman,senrobportman,center,"The International Trade Commission should also bring the full might of U.S. trade remedy law to bear on Russian companies, which trade unfairly, similar to how they treat Chinese companies."
Portman,senrobportman,center,"4th on trade, there are two additional things we can do to bring pressure to bear on President Putin. Access to our market is a privilege, not a right, and we should not give Russia normal access."
Portman,senrobportman,center,"3rd on tax treatment, suspend our tax treaty with Moscow and explore options to remove other tax benefits from Russian businesses. The U.S. has income tax treaties with foreign countries to facilitate investment and prevent double taxation."
Portman,senrobportman,center,2nd we need more sanctions and we need to implement them faster. We need to remove all Russia’s banks’ access to the global financial system. Russia must be financially cut off from the rest of the world.
Portman,senrobportman,center,"1st on the military side, we must redouble our efforts with urgency to provide Ukraine with the equipment and munitions and, where necessary, the immediate training, to improve their air defenses and give them better offensive air capabilities."

Portman,senrobportman,center,This bill will give authority to the USTR to negotiate new trade agreements with like-minded countries without a small handful of countries obstructing progress. Let’s get this passed.
Portman,senrobportman,center,"For too long, China has been given free ride on the global trading system and been able to act as a spoiler to prevent trade agreements from going forward. That’s why  &amp; I have introduced the Trading System Preservation Act."
Portman,senrobportman,center,This crisis has led to more American lives being lost and families devastated.
Portman,senrobportman,center,"This crisis is a direct result of the Biden administration’s policies &amp; has led to a surge in illicit narcotics like fentanyl, heroin and meth coming over our border. Seizures of heroin &amp; meth doubling over the last month. "
Portman,senrobportman,center,"The February  operational statistics are alarming and once again show an increase in border arrests, with a reported nearly 164,973 total encounters at the border in February. This includes more than 12K unaccompanied children, up from 8K encounters in Jan."
Portman,senrobportman,center,Timing is critical. The U.S. should to be creative and figure out how to get this done.
Portman,senrobportman,center,Disappointed that the Biden admin continues to refuse to take steps to help send MiG 29 fighter jets to Ukraine. Ukraine says they need them badly to defend themselves &amp; Poland has offered to donate them as long as we sell Poland more planes to backfill their needs.
Portman,senrobportman,center,We must do everything they can to get this critical aid to Europe as quickly as possible.
Portman,senrobportman,center,I saw firsthand the humanitarian need during my visit to Poland last weekend. The U.S. has a key role to play in getting both refugees and those Ukrainians who are trapped in their war-torn cities the humanitarian aid they need to survive.
Portman,senrobportman,center,Was honored to meet with members of the Hamilton County SWAT team this weekend and thank them for the service they provide to our community.

Portman,senrobportman,center,"Programs in this law will now receive even more support for this year (FY 2022)– a 21% increase over FY 2021 levels.

Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Supporting peaceful coexistence in the Mideast means reinforcing the Abraham Accords -- not rewarding Palestinian terrorism by resuming aid to the PA.I agree with . When we stand with Israel, our partners join us and Israel's enemies lose. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,". has it right: “The bill for decades of complacency and neglect is coming due at a dangerous moment, as China ramps up its fleet.” Congress must act and give our military the resources it needs! "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Please join me today in praying for our Gold Star Spouses – the wives and husbands of our fallen troops. We honor their unique strength and service today and always, and we promise never to forget their sacrifice.  "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Glad  is putting Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funding, which Congress increased by $50M over 's FY22 request, to good use with credible lethal and nonlethal military assistance. I urge the administration to deliver these weapons &amp; equipment ASAP."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,Our military is facing recruiting challenges at a time we can hardly afford to reduce end strength. This is a long-term challenge due to our country's demographics - but the President's relentless pursuit of progressive policies at DOD doesn't help. 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan was a disaster of ’s making. This commission will ensure that future policymakers learn from these mistakes. I've named Dr. Colin Jackson, a scholar and former DASD, to serve on the commission &amp; look forward to its report. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Congress sent  a clear message last year that his defense budget was inadequate.This year's isn't much better - and historic inflation is jeopardizing progress. W/ the significant threats we face, real growth on top of inflation is what we need."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"I want to echo 's thanks to our troops. Let's also recognize 's heroic contributions to Operation Warp Speed, which - under General Perna's leadership - developed, produced, and delivered three COVID vaccines in record time, saving millions of lives. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Thank you, General McKenzie, for your service. Congratulations to General Kurilla for stepping up as  Commander at this critical time. You know the region well and bring a great deal of experience to the job, and I look forward to working closely with you. "

Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Proud of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group. Their extension makes clear the Navy is too small, the 7-year delay of the USS Gerald R. Ford has real impact, and ships need to get in and out of maintenance on time. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,". CDR Gen Wolters said US basing in Europe has ""got to change"" in response to Russian invasion of Ukraine &amp; threats against  Allies. I agree &amp; urge the admin to work w/ Congress to bolster our forces' ability to deter Putin from continuing his reckless violence. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"If President Biden ends Title 42 without a plan for securing the border, it will be an even worse crisis of his own making. It is absolutely disgraceful that the administration is reportedly considering asking our veterans to pay the price for this. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,President Biden’s own  echoes what I’ve said many times: We’re in the “most dangerous security environment” in decades. We must meet the moment and make sure our military has what it needs to defend our country in this increasingly unsafe world. 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Our world is getting more dangerous, and accordingly, defense spending should increase as well. But under ’s latest budget, it’s just 3.1% of our economy – almost the lowest it’s been since the Cold War ended. Congress will act to right this ship. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Thank you to the 11K+  personnel who are still deployed across the country in COVID response operations.Measured against other U.S. troop deployments, this represents the fifth largest in the world. These heroes are helping keep our communities safe and healthy. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Kay and I are praying for the people of Israel. We must remain resolved and vigilant in the fight against the evil of terrorism. As ranking member of , I will do everything I can to help keep our Israeli friends safe."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Pleased to see DOD &amp; NNSA continuing long-overdue investments to rebuild our aging nuclear forces, but I'm still concerned that the administration remains unwilling to reclaim the ground we’ve already lost to China &amp; Russia. Expect  to put us back on a more secure path "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"I led Congress in creating the Pacific Deterrence Initiative to help improve our military posture in that region. As long as we resource it properly, it could be a game changer in long-term competition against China as well."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"We need to think long and hard about our deterrence efforts in Europe and around the world. As  CDR Gen. Wolters said yesterday, the European Deterrence Initiative has been a game-changer in supporting Ukraine &amp; our NATO allies over last month. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,This is exactly what  &amp; I have been saying. Cutting key capabilities like the sea-launched cruise missile shows that this administration is unable to confront the dangerous reality of strategic threats we face. Why doesn’t  listen to his military experts? 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"For the 2nd year,  submitted a defense budget w/o adequate growth above inflation.  &amp; I asked the Admin for detailed info to better understand how inflation is affecting ’s buying power. See our full letter here:  "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,It was great to finally have the opportunity to meet in person again with  students from 's Oklahoma Agricultural Leadership Encounter. This is a bright group of agricultural students with great futures ahead of them. 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Today, on , we remember and honor the 9 million Americans who earned the title of U.S. veteran during the Vietnam War. We remain forever grateful to those who served and sacrificed on behalf of our nation. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Historic inflation rates driven by ’s policies are hurting our troops, just like every other U.S. family. Inflation is also driving up key military needs like fuel, labor &amp; supplies. Congress needs more transparency on inflation so we can give our military what it needs. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"With increasingly capable Chinese and Russian submarines on patrol more often, the effect of canceling the fatally flawed LCS ASW package is at least an 11-year gap in ASW frigates. Another unacceptable Navy acquisition debacle. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,What’s worse than 's budget only proposing to build 9 Navy warships (while retiring 24)? One of these new ships double-counts a ship previously authorized by Congress (and doing so is a violation of law).
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,The  says we need at least 355 battle force ships to counter future threats from China &amp; Russia. ’s budget takes a step backward – decommissioning 24 while building just 8 new ones. This puts us on track to a SMALLER Navy fleet over the next 5 years. Illogical. 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,Received the classified 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS). I look forward to reviewing it and the forthcoming unclassified version. The world is more dangerous than it was when the last NDS came out - so we need to make sure our budget matches the strategy and threats.
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"President Biden’s defense budget reflects the world he wishes for — but not the world as it is. Unfortunately, it falls far short of where we need to be to confront all the threats we face. My full statement ➡️  "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"What’s happening at the border is a crisis, and I’m concerned it’s going to get worse. ICYMI - Yesterday, we learned that  is requesting additional  support at the southwest border. Good."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"This week, the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists attacked Saudi oil facilities multiple times. The Biden admin must:- Stand with our Saudi partners and help them counter this threat.- Redesignate the Houthis as terrorists.- Not lift sanctions on the IRGC, which aids the Houthis. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,My statement w/  in response to ’s reported decision to cut key U.S. nuke modernization programs - another example of this admin’s inability to confront the dangerous reality of the strategic threats facing us and our allies. ⬇️ 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"American families have been feeling the effects of inflation for months already – before Russia invaded Ukraine. It’s also affecting ’s buying power. We need to be realistic about the cost of military operations, logistics &amp; personnel under this admin’s policies. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,Congress gave  $3B to send additional weapons &amp; equipment to Ukraine — an unprecedented amount of authority. Such a crisis certainly merits it.  should use ALL of this authority NOW. There’s no reason not to — and there’s no more time to waste.
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Remember how much Democrats criticized President Trump for sending the National Guard to the border? Well, it worked. Now, under President Biden, we've had 12 straight months of +150K illegal immigrants stopped at the border."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,🚨 This is a big deal→ General VanHerck of  just confirmed that the Biden administration is working on a NEW request for additional  support at the southern border - finally admitting just how bad things are. 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"North Korea’s likely first ICBM test since 2017 is another example of how dangerous our world is becoming. ’s upcoming Nuclear Posture Review needs to accept the reality of these threats and endorse a strong, flexible U.S. deterrent. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,Every American has been paying the price at the pump for the Biden administration's anti-American energy policies.Watch my full exchange with witnesses at today's  hearing at the link below ⬇️  
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,Today marks one month since 's deterrence efforts failed &amp; Putin began his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainians have been fighting tirelessly ever since.The U.S. can and must send more military aid. There’s no sense in delaying now. “Just in time” will be too late.
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Broad recognition from  nominees that  shipbuilding, ship repair, and engineering centers are underfunded. Congress must come together to make these critical investments, because ' business as usual won’t cut it. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"I led 40 of my  &amp;  colleagues in a letter to  urging him to request a 5% increase ABOVE inflation for national defense in this year's budget.If we don't make these investments today, we will not be able to defend our nation or allies in the future. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"As  dragged his feet on aid to Ukraine, the only thing he made clear was what he would NOT do to respond to Russia. We need to send clear signals to both allies and adversaries--which is why I've argued to send more lethal aid to Ukraine for years "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,Ensuring Oklahoma children have a quality education from kindergarten to high school is vital. I am glad to introduce the Advancing Toward Impact Aid Full Funding Act to fully fund Impact Aid and support K-12 education across Oklahoma and our nation. 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"As  nominee for Pentagon acquisition chief told  this AM, the capacity of our defense industrial base is a deterrent of its own. We must move swiftly to expand production capacity for key munitions not only for ourselves, but for our allies."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"I can remember when it was unquestionable that the U.S. had the best of everything, and we don’t anymore. Today I questioned 2 key DOD nominees about how they will help address readiness challenges &amp; keep our military on the cutting edge.Watch here ↓ "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Kay and I are praying for those who knew and loved Capt. Tomkiewicz, Capt. Reynolds, GySgt. Speedy and Cpl. Moore. We will forever remember and honor their service to the  and to our nation. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,We made great progress under the Trump administration to give voice to the voiceless and I will continue to fight for every unborn baby—even if the Biden administration will not. 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"I joined  and a number of my GOP colleagues in standing for life this week. We intro'ed a resolution to overturn the harmful Biden rule on the Title X Family Planning Program, which allows the government to funnel millions of taxpayer dollars to abortion providers."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Wrong, . Through Operation Warp Speed, the Trump admin produced 3 safe and effective COVID vaccines in 10 months -- a record that 'experts' doubted was possible. The Biden admin inexplicably gutted that program, and now blames President Trump for its own failures. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Since Putin’s indiscriminate killing of women and children and bombing of hospitals and schools isn’t enough for President Xi to close the door on Russia,  must make it clear: If China provides Russia with military aid, there will be a price to pay."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Don’t forget – this reported deal does not &amp; will not have broad support in Congress. My  colleagues &amp; I will support a policy that blocks Iran’s path to nuclear weapons, constrains its ballistic missiles &amp; confronts its support for terrorism. Absent that - it's DOA "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Let's review:✖️Hamas/Hezbollah apologist  heads the US negotiating team.✖️Malley conceded so much to Iran that his colleagues resigned.✖️Malley is negotiating with Iran via Russia, which  just accused of war crimes."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"I'll say it again: Our world is getting more dangerous. We must boost $ on our national security, expand cooperation on regional missile defenses, modernize &amp; adapt our nuclear deterrent &amp; maintain long-standing nuclear declaratory policies to deter rogue states like North Korea."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"This was North Korea’s 10th missile test in 2022 alone, and with reports of enrichment work restarting at the Yongbyon facility, I don’t see any indications that they’re slowing down the pace of their provocations. "

Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Pleased to name Sen. Jon Kyl &amp; former NNSA Admin Lisa Gordon-Hagerty to the Strategic Posture Commission Our nuclear forces are the bedrock of our national defense. We must refocus on meeting the challenges posed by multiple nuclear-armed adversaries, now &amp; in the future. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,Top  &amp;  generals echoed what  has been hearing for months: The United States is less effective at countering terrorist organizations since we withdrew from Afghanistan and Somalia. Over-the-horizon just doesn’t work as well.
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"After hearing ’s plea to Congress this morning, I urge  to send more military aid now. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,I'm extremely pleased the new German coalition government decided to procure F-35 as their next-gen fighter. This is a force multiplier for the U.S. &amp; our allies &amp; partners &amp; ensures Germany will continue its contribution to  nuclear burden sharing.
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,It is unconscionable that the Biden administration might lift terrorism sanctions on the IRGC to re-enter the failed 2015 Iran deal while the IRGC is still targeting Americans for murder.Watch 's exchange with  CDR Gen. McKenzie 👇 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"With my fellow Armed Services, Foreign Relations, and Intelligence Ranking Members, yesterday I urged ,  and the Biden admin to send critical military weapons and equipment NOW. ⬇️ "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"President ’s remarks to the Congress were full of courage, conviction and leadership. Now, as much as ever, we must stand with Ukraine — and that means sending robust assistance as quickly as possible."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"The CBP data on illegal immigration is clear—we remain in the worst border crisis in history and President Biden’s continued inability, or unwillingness, to do anything about it is making matters worse."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,It is outrageous that people are still forced to wear masks on airplanes and other forms of transit—despite the fact the government has dropped mask mandates virtually everywhere else. I was proud to vote to disapprove of the mask mandate for all transportation modes today.
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Now that Congress has passed emergency aid for , the Biden administration must use that funding NOW to provide the Ukrainian Armed Forces with more of the most effective weapons and equipment it’s already using to repel Russia. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"al-Shabaab is the most violent al-Qaeda affiliate in the world &amp; getting stronger. Our  gen. agrees &amp; says we're ""backsliding""← why I opposed removing troops from Somalia.Why hasn’t the White House made a decision to put troops &amp; capabilities back in Somalia? "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"When Pres. Trump launched Op. Warp Speed in May 2020, 'experts' said it would take years to test, produce and distribute an effective COVID vaccine.  But under Gen. Perna's leadership, this happened within 7 months. Read and learn from his insights ↓"

Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Why would China give more weapons to Putin, who has shown his willingness to use those weapons to bomb hospitals and apartment buildings in Ukraine?"
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"This weekend, Iran fired 6 ballistic missiles toward the US consulate and military base in Erbil. These strikes highlight the danger of lifting sanctions on Iran w/o addressing its ballistic missile program and terrorism, as  is trying to do. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"I joined 48 of my  colleagues to send a strong message to  on his reported Iran deal: This current deal does not have broad support in Congress, and we will not let it stand. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"President Biden continues to hamstring domestic production while looking to import oil and gas from countries run by dictators who wage war on their neighbors, fund terrorism and suppress the rights of their own people. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Through executive action after executive action, President Biden has taken NIMBYism to a global level. Oil from Iran and Venezuela is on the table, but not our own abundant domestic supply. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"As gas prices hit all-time record highs this week, the Biden administration wants you to believe Putin is to blame when the president’s own policies have been driving prices higher for more than a year. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Each day brings news of growing strategic threats to our nation. A bipartisan majority in Congress understands this danger and is ready to act. The administration needs to help us rebuild a nuclear force that can deter, and if necessary defeat, these threats to our way of life. "

Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Instead of focusing on making our world safer from threats, President Biden has focused our Department of Defense on progressive priorities like climate change and a “woke” social agenda. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"This administration has proven unable to take calculated risks, to think creatively, or to make the investments in national security across the government that would gird America for long-term strategic competition."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Across the globe, our adversaries, like Communist China, are taking notes on how the United States and our allies and partners are responding to the crises in Ukraine and Afghanistan. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,President Biden’s Mideast policy:-Relieved pressure on the Houthis.-Turned Afghanistan over to the Taliban.-Offers Iran billions $ in sanctions relief.I’m sorry to see our partners ignore our President. But he made this mess. 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Vladmir Putin is killing innocent women and children in Ukraine, but the Biden administration is so focused on returning to the failed Iran nuclear deal, they are letting Russia dictate the terms.  "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"For many, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a wake-up call to what I’ve been saying for years: Threats are growing, and our defense budget needs to grow accordingly. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"It’s past time we shut down Putin’s profits from Russian oil imports, but we need to unleash American energy instead of the Biden Admin’s plan of relying on brutal dictators. Now more than ever it is clear that energy security is national security."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"From the get-go, I told  it would be a mistake to return to Obama's flawed Iran deal. Any new deal should be comprehensive, inclusive of our allies &amp; partners, permanent &amp; transparent. It seems the Biden admin's deal will be none of the above. It's worse than before. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,Agree with  ADM Richard's statements at today’s hearing. We are in a new era. The time has come to look at what additional nuclear capabilities we need before China and Russia leave us behind. 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Since 2015, I've made sure the annual defense authorization bill included meaningful defensive aid for Ukraine — and I’m also going to make sure Congress acts ASAP to give even more support, above the admin's request, to the brave Ukrainian military and protect our own interests."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,We saw Russia's Ukraine buildup a year ago. Yet the Biden admin dragged their feet at every turn. They:- Should have sent more robust aid months ago.- Should have sanctioned Russia months ago.- Should not have waited til the crisis began to take our defense budget seriously. 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"The health &amp; safety of military families is my top priority. I’m glad  is taking steps to make things right for families in Red Hill, Hawaii. But I have a few questions for  about the operational risk of taking this key fuel storage facility offline. My statement ↓ "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,Congress must act to support Ukraine and defend U.S. interests in Europe. My statement ⬇️ 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"It’s good to see our NATO allies, like , continuing to step up defense investment in the wake of Putin’s unwarranted and unprovoked aggression. We must keep sending a strong, unified message – it’s clear that is all he will listen to. "
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"President Biden's Mideast foreign policy in a nutshell: eager to give Iran many billions of dollars in sanctions relief, but still deliberating on how to engage our longtime partners."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,I hope senior Biden officials don’t OK  ’s deal w/ Iran. To recap:-Malley is a longtime apologist for Iran’s terror proxies.-His (now-former) colleagues resigned to protest what he’s conceding to Iran.-Now Russia is bragging about Iran’s huge wins. 👇 
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Kay &amp; I are praying for President  &amp; the people of Ukraine as they fight for the soil and soul of their nation.My colleagues in Congress and I are working to get you more military &amp; humanitarian aid, and more pressure on Putin to stop his reckless aggression ASAP."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"Perhaps worst of all, the admin told us they’d conduct “over-the-horizon” counterterrorism to mitigate the terrorist threat against the U.S. In reality, we’ve carried out no strikes &amp;don’t have the intelligence to know what al-Qaeda or ISIS is planning."
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,President Biden is solely responsible for the terrible decision and the chaos that followed in Afghanistan.
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,President Biden didn’t acknowledge the rushed withdrawal from Afghanistan once in his . Not even to commemorate the 13 American service members who lost their lives in Kabul on August 26. We must not forget.
Inhofe,JimInhofe,right,"If the Biden admin re-enters the failed Iran nuclear deal, Iran will receive major sanctions relief, which it will likely spend on its terror proxies.  Note: negotiations have been led by Robert Malley, who is a longtime defender of those terrorists: "

Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,The next episode of the Breakdown will be out Friday—join me &amp;  with  as we discuss the latest chaos at the border caused by 1600 Penn Ave. Subscribe now so you don’t miss an episode. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,The Biden Admin is requesting another $10 billion in COVID spending yet they’re saying COVID is over at the border. I pressed DHS Secretary on why their policies are so inconsistent. Watch: 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,The Ukrainians are the only thing standing between Russia &amp; the rest of Europe—we should be providing them with everything they need to defend themselves. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Biden’s policies are incentivizing illegal immigration instead of addressing the problems he created. He is only making matters worse. You can listen to my conversation about the  with  on the  Show here 👇 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,It's time for Biden to start delivering on his promises to help Ukraine. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Joining Skyler on  &amp; Lee on KTOK radio—tune in.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"I am not going to support Judge Jackson to the highest Court in the land for a lifetime appt.A SCOTUS nom is a lifetime appt—we should make sure any Justice is committed to limited gov, the original interpretation of the Constitution &amp; a clear dedication to impartial justice. "
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,I will bring forward a resolution of disapproval to stop this Administration’s plan to move people into the country faster.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"They’re firing members of the military for not getting vaccinated &amp; Americans still have to wear mask on an airplane because they say there is still a pandemic. But if you want to cross the border illegally, COVID is over at the border."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Biden Admin continues to say they’re “following the science” on COVID but at the same time saying there isn’t a problem at the border. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Joining  shortly —tune in. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,The root cause of illegal immigration is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Joining  on Rob Schmitt tonight w/ —watch here 👇
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"If Biden wants to lower gas prices, he should spend more time talking about supply solutions with the many US energy companies he’s alienated &amp; less time glad-handing climate-change activists."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,opening up federal lands to energy exploration &amp; providing regulatory consistency to allow US energy producers certainty to invest again.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"We need long-term policy changes like common sense regulations on pipelines, preventing the Federal Reserve from cutting off access to capital for oil &amp; gas companies,"
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"This is his 3rd major release from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is designed to protect our national security, not the President’s poll numbers."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"Now, the most progressive President ever is releasing 180 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an attempt to bring down the prices that his policies raised."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"Apparently President Biden just discovered that the American economy runs on oil &amp; natural gas. After attacking traditional energy sources that fuel our nation for a year, the price at the gas pump has risen significantly. Then Putin’s invasion of Ukraine made prices even worse."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,I will bring forward a resolution of disapproval to stop this Administration’s plan to move people into the country faster.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,What we expected all along—Biden and his team are lifting a protection at the border that has rapidly expelled 1.1 million illegal border crossers. We are about to see an epidemic level of unknown people coming across the border who will then disappear into the country.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"The White House is currently trying to renegotiate the Iran Nuclear Deal through Russian representatives. If that sounds like an April Fool’s joke, it isn’t. I firmly oppose any re-entry into the Iran Nuclear Deal."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,It’s time for Biden to start delivering on his promises to help Ukraine. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"Instead of reducing the passport backlog &amp; modernizing the application process,  is focused on woke gender ideology."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"I look forward to coming together with our allies, instead of begging for minerals from China."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Oklahomans know it’s more important to solve our dependence on China for minerals we use every day in everything from cellphones &amp; batteries to military gear &amp; medical devices.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"Biden &amp; the Democrats are pushing a ‘China competition bill’ with billions of dollars for the UN Green Climate Fund, green cards to business people with Chinese Communist Party ties &amp; dozens of unrelated woke ‘discrimination’ studies."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Anyone who wants to stand up to China needs to support this bill to diminish our dependence on China’s critical &amp; rare earth minerals by encouraging trade partnerships with our allies.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Ironically enough in order to fund the China bill we’ll have to go further in debt with China in order to pay for the bill.  We’ll have to borrow more money from China to go compete with China. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"After meeting with Judge Jackson, I cannot state that I see that commitment. I have major concerns about past judicial activism, even cases where Judge Jackson has ignored the clear and explicit law written by Congress. I will oppose her confirmation next week."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"A Supreme Court nomination is a life-time appointment. We should make sure any Justice is committed to limited government, the original interpretation of the Constitution, and a clear dedication to impartial justice."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,I’ve been clear about my position on Judge Jackson’s judicial philosophy since I opposed her nomination to the DC Circuit Court last year.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,I raised concerns with  about this case months ago—glad to see that the Finnish government is upholding Paivi’s &amp; Bishop Pohjola’s fundamental rights of freedom of religion &amp; speech. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Several chances to tune in &amp; hear about the issues this morning. CC:    
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,We can &amp; should continue providing aid to the people of Ukraine. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Last year we had 2 million people illegally cross our border—the highest ever. Instead of addressing the problem he created Biden continues to make matters worse. The chaos needs to stop. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,It’s ironic that while we’re isolating Russia for their atrocities against Ukraine—right now Biden is using Russia as our proxy to re-negotiate the Iran Nuclear Deal. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,I call on my Senate colleagues to stand with me. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Biden’s plan to lift Title 42 at our border is a recipe for chaos during an already out of control crisis at our border. I will object to all DHS nominations that Leader Schumer brings to the floor until DHS provides us a plan that will end the chaos.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Oklahomans—I’ll be joining the conversation w/  &amp;  on  to talk about Ukraine—tune in.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"Today &amp; everyday, we remember the bravery &amp; sacrifice of the many Americans that served in Vietnam. Thank you to the veterans who served. "
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"Today, Oklahomans are going to work, going to school, working in their yard, or just spending time with their family. We enjoy that freedom &amp; that peace today because of our veterans who have fought for our freedom around the world, including in Vietnam."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Joining  on  radio shortly to talk about Biden’s border crisis—tune in.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"Thank you to , , , , ,  &amp;  for joining me."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,For the Department of Justice to claim otherwise is a gross misuse of their authority—I’m calling on them to immediately rescind their memorandum targeting parents who speak up for their children. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Parents have the right to direct the upbringing &amp; education of their children. That does not make them terrorists.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"It is vital that the US stand up for religious freedom &amp; unequivocally hold perpetrators accountable for violence, oppression &amp; genocide against people of faith worldwide through the imposition of sanctions. "
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"In America, we believe every person has worth &amp; dignity. This belief has allowed us to become the world’s greatest defender of basic, fundamental human rights—including the right to life, the right to due process, the right to free speech &amp; the right to freely live your faith."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,My statement on Biden’s budget proposal for 2023 👇 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,DHS expects over 1 million people to illegally cross our border in 6 weeks if Title 42 is lifted—Biden needs to get the crisis at our border under control. I talked with  about this &amp; more on  radio. Listen to our conversation here ⬇️ 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Congress needs to address inflation &amp; ballooning debt—not continue to find more ways to frivolously spend taxpayer dollars.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"Last year, under Biden’s policies, we had a record high number of illegal crossings &amp; record low number of deportations—his plans to “secure our border” is an invitation to chaos. Biden needs to do his job &amp; enforce the law. "
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,. &amp; I are calling on  to do more to assist the people of Ukraine during this crisis—that includes speeding up the process to get Ukrainian orphans out of the warzone &amp; onto American soil.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,The US can be doing more to help Ukrainian orphans who are already in the process of being adopted by American families.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,If the Biden Admin ends Title 42 we can expect more people than last year moving across our borders—Biden would be making a bad situation even worse. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"The Chinese Communist Party is a threat to the national security of the United States. The DOJ’s decision to terminate a program that defends us from Chinese espionage in our nation is misguided, dangerous &amp; does not protect the American people."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Our men &amp; women defend us &amp; this nation every day—they deserve better from their leadership.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,The Secretary’s lack of action to protect our service members’ right to religious freedom is completely unacceptable which is why I asked the DOD Inspector General to investigate DOD’s religious accommodation process.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,It has now been 2 months since I sent a letter to Sec. of Defense Austin demanding to know why the DOD has granted hardly any nearly zero requests for religious accommodations from the COVID-19 vaccine.  I requested a response by February 1st—but he still hasn’t responded.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"The American people do not like illegal immigration—especially when it is unlimited, chaotic &amp; coming from every single country in the world. The American people just want Biden to do his job &amp; enforce the law. "
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Biden needs to stop talking about helping Ukraine &amp; actually do it. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"This is what I’ve been warning about for weeks—removing Title 42 will make Biden’s border crisis even worse. In the last 4 months Border Patrol encountered 6,400 Russian citizens illegally crossing our border.6,400 Russian citizens illegally crossed our border in 4 months. "
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"By putting this rule in place, Biden is once again proving his obsession w/ abortion. I will continue to do everything I can to stand up to the most pro-abortion president we’ve ever seen &amp; his admin that wants to promote &amp; increase abortion in our nation."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Health care protects life; abortion takes life. We are standing up to the Biden Administration allowing taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions—his plan is an obvious violation of the clear legal mandate to have separate payments for abortion &amp; health care.

Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,     
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"It’s ironic (or right on cue) that YouTube banned the CPAC conference which included my panel on Big Tech censorship—don’t worry, I also posted it on 👇 CC:     "
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"It’s not , it’s just madness. You shared your thoughts &amp; narrowed it down from the  to the  biggest misuses of taxpayer dollars.It doesn’t stop here—comment the number that you think is the biggest waste of taxpayer dollars 👇 "
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,More on how my colleagues and I are working to prevent this from happening:
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"Creating a federal database of religious beliefs for federal employees with no guardrails allows supervisors to intimidate people away from living their faith, rather than encouraging the free exercise of faith."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"People of faith live their faith every day, at home, at work &amp; in our houses of worship. No one, including federal employees, should have to check their religious liberty or right to personal privacy at the door when they go to work."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Biden’s plan to make the border look less chaotic is to bus thousands of illegal migrants at a time into the interior of the country. This isn’t a plan—this is a recipe for chaos. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"DHS is estimating that once Title 42 is lifted, over 1 million people will illegally cross our southern border. Their plan is not to turn them around—their plan is to bus them into the interior of our country. "
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,It is a foolish mistake to allow nuclear weapons in Iran. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,We need to do what we can to protect the world &amp; the Ukrainian people from chemical warfare. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Joining the conversation on  shortly—tune in.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"Since January 2021, we’ve “encountered” 2.35 million people illegally crossing our southern border.The only thing keeping this number from skyrocketing even higher is Title 42. Biden &amp; his administration want to get rid of Title 42—it is absolutely essential we maintain it. "
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"Inflation, supply issues &amp; high energy costs hurt everyone—especially farmers trying to buy fertilizer.On this , I’m working to lower fertilizer costs for US farmers so they can continue putting food on the tables of American families."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,I’ve been asking the Biden Admin for basic clarity on his denial of religious exemptions for his vaccine mandates. I’m not asking for anything unreasonable—I’m just asking for an answer. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,It is imperative we have justices who are committed to the original meaning of the Constitution &amp; the rule of law. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,The only person that’s indecisive on helping Ukraine is President Biden. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,nan
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"We live in a nation that honors personal freedom—including free speech. Instead of honoring this right, in a panel that looked to honor both sides of a conversation, Yale Law School allowed “protestors” to verbally attack &amp; physically threaten panelists they did not agree with."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"In a panel at Yale Law School that ironically was centered around free speech, “protestors” derailed the panel &amp; law enforcement had to be called in to deescalate the situation."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"My team is in contact with Kingston city leaders &amp; we are tracking the storms across the state. We are ready to assist as the damage is assessed. Cindy and I are praying for all those impacted by tonight's storm. Stay weather aware, Oklahoma. "
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,Biden should have sent MiGs &amp; other aircrafts to Ukraine 3 weeks ago instead of dithering &amp; allowing the Russians to take out more &amp; more of Ukraine. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,What world are we living in? Men &amp; women are different. Title IX is supposed to ensure women have an equal chance to share their athletic ability with the world.  
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,I am also proud to speak up for &amp; honor the right to life of every individual—including babies in the womb with Down Syndrome.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"Our friends, family members and neighbors with Down Syndrome are joyous, wonderful people who deserve as much out of life as every other person.  is an important reminder that all people are created in the image of God &amp; are worthy of dignity &amp; respect."

Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"We need answers on why drug prices remain high, especially as Seniors’ pocketbooks are being hit faster than ever with Biden’s 7.9% inflation &amp; rising prices.Watch my Q&amp;A during a hearing on getting to the bottom of how we lower prescription drug prices👇"
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,All I’m asking is for Americans to be able to see where &amp; how their taxpayer dollars were spent. They have a right to know.
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,This map shows all of the countries whose nationals have illegally crossed our southwest border—it’s literally every country in the world. 
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"We’re not facing record numbers at the border—these are all-time high numbers of 2.35 million illegal crossings at our southwest border, but we have record low numbers of who is being deported out.  This is by design. This is not accidental. "
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"Nonprofits are the best example of our community safety net—rising to the occasion to come alongside our struggling neighbors, brothers &amp; sisters. I’m working to ensure that we support our non-profit sector by incentivizing giving in our tax code."
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,"Where we have the ability to do good, we should do good. We stand with the people of Ukraine. "
Lankford,SenatorLankford,right,14/ The written plan for how  will manage the historic and overwhelming influx of migrants at the Southwest Border. 
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,I’ve conducted an open forum town hall an average of once every 10 days since being elected to the Senate. It has shaped many of my efforts to secure help for the people back home. Thank you to the thousands of Oregonians who have participated over the years!
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"I just finished my 500th open forum town hall as a Senator representing Oregon. I host a forum in each of our 36 counties, every year. They’re an incredibly effective way to hear from Oregonians from every corner of the state, and I'm dedicated to continuously hearing from folks."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Glad to see this pause extended—this is the right move to give families some relief. Now, we need  to take action on meaningful debt cancellation. "
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,Glad to see  move to ban asbestos—long overdue. But this only covers one-sixth of recognized asbestos fibers—I urge EPA to ban them all! I’ll keep working in Congress to protect Americans’ health and ban asbestos once and for all. 
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Last week, I called on  to extend the pause on student debt repayment and move quickly toward meaningful student debt cancellation. We need swift action."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"This week, I’ll vote YES on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Judge Jackson is immensely qualified and has an unimpeachable character—she’ll serve the Supreme Court and our country well."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Big Oil is gouging us at the pump—we need to tax those ill-gotten profits and give rebates to Americans. This is a short term solution—long term, we need to take power away from Big Oil and tyrants like Putin by investing in clean energy—our planet and security are at stake. "
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,The images coming out of Bucha and elsewhere in Ukraine are horrific. These gruesome war crimes cannot go unpunished. The mass graves must be investigated and Putin must be held accountable for the atrocities being committed by the Russian military. 
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Oregonians in every part of the state should have access to safe, affordable housing. As we face a housing crisis magnified by COVID-19, this funding is critical to support every member of our communities through the pandemic and beyond."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is committed to making sure our judiciary system works for everyone in our country—not just for the privileged and powerful. I look forward to voting to  this week.
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"President Zelenskyy is right: a shift to green energy will take power out of the hands of tyrants like Putin who depend on oil and gas profits to fund their destruction. Europe has started accelerating their transition to renewables, but the United States can and must do more. "
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,This is HUGE. Congratulations to the Amazon workers who overcame Amazon’s serious union-busting tactics to unionize and advocate for fair wages and working conditions! We need to make it easier for everyone to organize at work—we must pass the ! 
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Non-flushable wipes wreak havoc on our ecosystems, health, and wastewater infrastructure. This week, I introduced a bill to wipe out non-flushable wipes from our wastewater systems."

Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,Mass timber from right here in Oregon can help us build back better and address our need for housing while creating jobs and critical workforce development opportunities for all Oregonians. 
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Lowering the cost of insulin and ALL other Rx drugs is key to make health care more affordable. That’s why I'm working to get my  for Medications Act passed. Reducing costs is crucial as we continue to work toward simple, seamless, health care for all."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Yesterday, the House voted to cap the out-of-pocket cost of insulin at $35 a month. This is a critical, life-saving step in the right direction—we need to get this done in the Senate."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,Everyone should have access to affordable and safe housing—and the pandemic exacerbated the housing crisis in Oregon and across the U.S. These grants will fund critical programs to support every member of our communities throughout this pandemic and beyond.
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"From my meeting with Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, it was clear that she is committed to making sure the Supreme Court defends government “of, by, and for the People”, not “of, by and for the Powerful”. "
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,Increasing vaccine access worldwide is absolutely crucial both to put the COVID-19 pandemic behind us and to prevent future pandemics. I will continue to work to ensure crucial global vaccine efforts are funded.

Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Proud to be partnering with you on this effort,  and . "
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Emergency preparedness is crucial to keeping our communities safe in the face of wildfire season, the pandemic, and whatever challenges Oregon faces. I was glad to help Benton County secure funding toward a new emergency operations center."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is supremely qualified—she’s served as a public defender, clerked for a Supreme Court justice, and was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit Court. Her experience and unimpeachable character will serve the Supreme Court—and all of America—well."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Today,  and I led 17 of our Senate colleagues in demanding answers from Postmaster Louis DeJoy on his choice to tie USPS to gas-powered vehicles instead of EVs.DeJoy's plan puts our planet and health in peril at a time when USPS and FedEx are going electric. "
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Proud to vote for and glad to see the Senate finally confirm key nuclear security, arms control, and nonproliferation  officials.

Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"No bill can erase years of violence and terror inflicted on Black Americans, but this is a step forward in reckoning with the racist violence inextricably entwined in our history as a nation and continuing to chart a course forward rooted in justice and equality."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Yesterday,  signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act into law—a long overdue move to finally make lynching a federal hate crime, after years of blocked efforts. It should not have taken this long for us to call lynching what it is: a hate crime."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"At the very least, Justice Thomas needs to recuse himself from all matters related to January 6th. Ginni Thomas’ involvement in efforts to overturn the election is a huge and unacceptable conflict of interest. "
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,Big Oil is gouging us at the pump. We need to act now to relieve the economic pain Americans are feeling! The windfall profits tax would fund rebates directly to consumers to offset the pain at the pump. 
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,Wastewater treatment facilities help keep Oregonians’ rivers and streams safe and clean. Non-flushable wipes cause costly damage and leave behind harmful micro-plastics. I’m introducing a bill to keep our water clean and treatment facilities functioning. 
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,I will continue to work toward student debt cancellation—passing the Affordable Loans for Any Student Act is one way to protect current borrowers in the meantime and future borrowers. 
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,Higher education should be a path to opportunity—not to a lifetime of debt. So many young people in our country are putting off plans for their future because of student loan burden. We can guarantee that no borrowers have to pay more than they can afford.
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,Justice Thomas's conduct raises egregious ethics and separation of powers issues. I joined colleagues in calling on him to recuse himself from any case related to January 6th and for the Supreme Court to instate a code of ethics for justices—long overdue. 
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,My full statement ⬇️ 
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"The Ethiopia Peace and Stabilization Act just passed in . After 16 months of conflict, this critical legislation will elevate the importance of access to humanitarian aid and hold perpetrators accountable for atrocities. I urge my colleagues to pass this law quickly."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,Every voter in our country should have the right to cast their ballot and know their vote counts. That is why I am fighting to pass federal protections to preserve our democracy for all Americans and stop the powerful and privileged from buying elections.
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,Had a productive call today with  discussing the crisis in Ethiopia. I urged her to continue working to quickly get needed humanitarian relief into Tigray and help facilitate an inclusive political process to resolve this terrible crisis.
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,My meeting with Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmed for me what her Judiciary Committee hearing showed the nation: she has an unimpeachable character and a depth of knowledge and experience that will be a true asset to the Supreme Court. 
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"I will continue fighting for federal non-discrimination policies to protect trans youth and all LGBTQ+ people from these hateful, unceasing attacks."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Every child should be able to navigate school without having to hide who they are, and every child should see themselves reflected in their lessons. This bill is a shameful attack on LGBTQ+ youth—part of a nationwide effort by the GOP rooted in hate and intolerance. "
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,We already know what side Koch is on. They’ve shown us again and again that they will always put their profits ahead of people and democratic principles—no matter the cost. This is just the latest example.
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,Earthquake preparedness and emergency planning is a big deal for Oregonians—many of us worry about the damage the “big one” would do to our communities. I’m proud to have secured critical funding to invest in the resilience of the Port of Portland.
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"In conjunction with that letter, we also led colleagues in calling on , , and  to address concerns with Thailand’s proposed law that would limit the ability of NGOs to help refugees from Burma’s oppression. "
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"The military coup and humanitarian crisis in Burma threatens the stability of the entire region. This week,  and I wrote to our allies in Thailand and asked them to do more to help those who need aid and to resolve this crisis."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Everyone should know who is funding our elections—the dark money pouring into our elections makes that impossible. If you’re not willing to stand behind what you’re saying, you shouldn’t be saying it! Passing the DISCLOSE Act will end the scourge of dark money."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"The GOP is waging an all-out attack on our freedom to vote: long lines in certain precincts on Election Day, limiting hours and parking, switching polling locations.One way we can make sure every American has a voice in our elections is expanding vote by mail nationwide!"
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Americans are feeling pain at the gas pump, and we need to act to tax oil companies’ windfall profits and give rebates to consumers. But we cannot tie ourselves to fossil fuels for years into the future—we must also invest in a just transition to clean energy."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Huge conflict of interest and separation of powers issues here. Justice Thomas must explain what he knew of his wife's involvement in inciting a coup attempt and why he didn't recuse. At the very least, he must recuse on all 1/6 and Big Lie matters. "
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"To end our vulnerability to gas price spikes and stop funding tyrants like Putin, it's critical that folks can charge their electric car as easily as they can fill up their gas tank. I urged  to prioritize this and was glad to speak with  about this yesterday."
Merkley,SenJeffMerkley,left,"Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has developed deep knowledge of multiple facets of the law through her experience as a district and circuit judge, public defender, and clerk for Justice Breyer. Her performance in front of the Judiciary Committee was impressive! "

Toomey,SenToomey,right,My condolences are with the family and loved ones of the Lebanon City Police officer who was killed last evening while on duty. Please join me in wishing the injured officers a full &amp; speedy recovery. A sobering reminder of the dangers officers face daily. 
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"The ruble’s rebound would seem to indicate that U.S. sanctions haven’t effectively crippled Russia’s economy. To give Ukraine a fighting chance, the U.S. must sever Putin’s revenue stream by cutting off Russian oil and gas sales globally. "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"This proposal would fly directly in the face of the American oil and gas industry's ability to meet the Biden Administration's call for ""more supply."" And while it’s a terrible policy to begin with, it's especially egregious given the state of the world today."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Instead of replicating E.U. energy policy that made the continent more dependent on Russian gas, we should bolster our domestic energy production so we can help wean our allies off energy imports from hostile nations."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"The largest burden of this punitive provision would be felt by domestic independent energy producers, which account for over 80% of U.S. oil and gas production."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Clearly, those responsible with writing the president’s budget weren't listening because the draft they released explicitly repeals immediate expensing for intangible drilling costs—  i.e., deductions for ordinary business expenses associated with oil and gas production."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"In light of Putin's relentless aggression in Ukraine, the Biden Administration pleaded with oil and gas companies, telling them that “in this moment of crisis, we need more supply.”"
Toomey,SenToomey,right,The vilification of stock buybacks is completely ridiculous. Stock buybacks are just a rational way for businesses to return marginal capital to their investors that they can't productively deploy elsewhere. This proposal is just a gesture to radical progressives. 
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Democrats veil their massive new tax hikes as ways to make the wealthy ""pay their fair share."" Yet the top 1% of Americans earn about 20% of all income and pay about 40% of all income taxes. If that's not fair, I'd sure love to know exactly what they consider “fair.” "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Today is , a day to thank Vietnam Era Veterans for their bravery, sacrifice, &amp; dedication to service. Too often, Vietnam Era veterans didn't receive the thanks they deserved. That's why my office has worked to honor over 8,000 of the many PA Vietnam veterans. "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,Lisa Cook’s record indicates that she is likely to inject further political bias into the 's work—at a time when hyper-focus on inflation and adherence to the Fed’s dual mandate is at its most critical.I urge my colleagues to oppose her nomination. 
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"When  watches  she should watch it with the volume on. If she did, she would know I never said we should raise taxes on anyone, unlike her, who never tires of proposing new tax increases."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,The president's remarks in Warsaw lacked a key message: Commitment to helping Ukraine win the war. Secondary sanctions on Russia would do just that by choking off the flow of money to Putin's war machine. Let's make the world decide: Do business with us or Russia. Not both. 
Toomey,SenToomey,right,The time to take action is now—while the demand for gas has lessened and American companies and others can help replace supplies ahead of next winter.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"While this would be temporarily costly for Europe, the price of thwarting Putin’s assault on the Ukrainian people isn’t as expensive as allowing him to reconstitute a Russian empire."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"In order to effectively sever his revenue stream, we must cut off Putin’s oil and gas sales globally by imposing secondary sanctions on the entirety of Russia’s financial sector."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,The joint task force’s timeline for reducing Europe’s dependence on Russian energy is too long to cripple Putin’s war machine in Ukraine.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"The next generation of Pennsylvanians is nothing short of inspiring, and that's thanks to great young minds like Victor Cai of Orefield, who came second in this year's . Congratulations Victor, you've made our commonwealth very proud! "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,The Ukrainian people have put up the most heroic fight for their freedom and for their sovereignty. We must do more. Secondary sanctions would cut off the funding for Putin's war machine by forcing the world to make a choice: Do business with the U.S. or Russia. Not both. 
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"It makes no sense that the Biden admin kills the Keystone XL pipeline and halts O&amp;G leases while pleading with foes like Iran/Venezuela to produce more. And because of Dem pipeline blockades, NE is importing gas from foreign countries instead of domestic producers in PA. "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Warmer weather, reserves, &amp; LNG supplied from the US and others will help Europe wean itself off Russian gas. It won’t be easy, but we must stop Putin from reconstituting a Russian empire. "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,Secondary sanctions are simple: Any financial institution that does business with a sanctioned Russian bank cannot do business with the U.S. No serious bank in the world can be shutout of the U.S. dollar market. This would devastate the Russian economy and Putin. 
Toomey,SenToomey,right,The world buys $5-7 billion of Russian oil and gas per week—a vital revenue stream for Putin's war machine. The Ukrainian people deserve better. We can cut off this cash flow and devastate Russia’s economy by imposing secondary sanctions. 
Toomey,SenToomey,right,It's past time to cripple Russia's economy and go after its energy sector. Shutting down sales of Russian energy will throttle Putin's ability to wage war. Read my op-ed in  on what we must do to make Putin realize his invasion was a disastrous mistake. 
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"To cut off Putin’s oil and gas sales globally, the U.S. should impose secondary sanctions on the entirety of Russia’s financial sector. These sanctions will give Ukraine a fighting chance to win this war, and defeating Putin now will prevent the next one. "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,Today’s action hijacks the democratic process and disrespects the limited scope of authority that Congress gave to the SEC.  This is a thinly-veiled effort to have unelected financial regulators set climate and energy policy for America.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"My deepest condolences go out to the  community along with the families, friends, and loved ones of the three individuals who were killed in this morning's accident in I-95. "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"While there has been virtually no evidence of Russia meaningfully using crypto to evade sanctions, Ukraine has been actively utilizing crypto to do tremendous good. Crypto donations for Ukraine have reached roughly $100M, helping Ukrainians defend against Russia’s invasion. "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Wishing everyone a happy, safe, and festive ! "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"They can begin by restarting the Keystone XL pipeline, expediting natural gas pipeline and LNG facility approvals, and repealing broad and punitive regulations and restrictions on American oil and gas production."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,Democrats in Congress and the Biden administration must reverse their policies that have led to higher prices for American families and allowed Putin to exercise energy dominance over Europe.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"I’m glad the FOMC has finally voted to raise rates, but there’s more to combating record-high inflation and skyrocketing gas prices than the Fed."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"The American people stand with Ukraine, and we must help them as they heroically fight for their lives."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,Stopping these funds from flowing to Putin’s war machine is a critical lifeline for the Ukrainian people.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"These sanctions would effectively prohibit foreign banks anywhere in the world, under the threat of U.S. sanctions, from making payments to Russian banks, including for oil and gas."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,America can lead the rest of the world in answering Zelensky’s call by imposing secondary sanctions on the entirety of Russia’s financial sector.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"But today, President Zelensky once again made clear that the Ukrainian people need our help, including by ensuring ‘the Russians do not receive a single penny’ to fund the killing of Ukrainians."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,President Zelensky and the Ukrainian people’s bravery and resolve has shown the world that Ukraine will do everything they can to stand up to Putin.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"No one likes ""falling back"" into archaic practices, like changing our clocks twice a year.  That's why the Senate just unanimously passed our bipartisan bill which would end this disruptive practice and make Daylight Savings Time permanent in November of 2023. On to the House!"
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"The Biden administration should nominate in her place an individual who will focus exclusively on implementing the Fed’s statutory mandates of stable prices, full employment, and supervision of bank holding companies."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"The Senate’s bipartisan rejection of Sarah Bloom Raskin’s nomination sends a powerful message to the Fed, and to all financial regulators, that it is not their job to allocate capital or stray from their mission to pursue extraneous or politically charged campaigns."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"As we’ve repeatedly said, Republican members of the Banking Committee are willing to vote on the other four Fed nominees. I hope Chairman Brown will immediately move forward with scheduling a vote for this week."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"With inflation at a 40-year high, gas prices skyrocketing, and Russia waging an energy-funded war, the last thing the American people need are unelected bureaucrats advancing policies that will cause energy costs to rise."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"As Senator Manchin suggested today, Ms. Raskin’s past advocacy for having the Federal Reserve allocate capital and discriminate against traditional energy companies would not only politicize the Fed, but weaken economic growth at a crucial moment in history."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"I figured out what the admin's energy policy is: Burn a lot more energy, just so long as it's not American. It's unbelievable!Instead of leaning on nations like Venezuela &amp; Iran to offset Russian energy, we should ramp up production of cleaner, safer American natural gas/oil. "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"This is absurd. The White House seems to think the world should burn any oil/gas—as long as it isn't American! American LNG is cleaner &amp; more environmentally friendly than foreign alternatives. It can help end Europe's dependence on Russian energy, which is fueling Putin's war. "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"An omnibus is fatally flawed because it circumvents what should be a deliberate process and removes Congress’ ability to scrutinize and amend individual spending items. For the sake of America’s fiscal health, I could not support this bill."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,Buried amongst the 2700+ pages of this bill is the promise to make America's debt worse without any effort to rein in excessive government spending nor tackle-out-of-control regulatory agencies.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"For over a year, Congress punted the appropriations process, and, as a result, there's now a monstrosity of an omnibus, which includes excessive spending and the first use of earmarks in over a decade."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Ukraine is in dire need of support. I fully endorse providing additional funding as they fight for their lives. This could pass with overwhelming support, which would show the US resolutely supports Ukraine. Instead, it's tied to a bill more than 100x larger than the aid."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"The administration can start by reversing its disastrous anti-energy policies: restart the Keystone XL pipeline, expedite natural gas pipeline approvals, repeal its broad, punitive regulations on America’s oil and gas production, and withdraw the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"I’m glad the FOMC will finally hike rates next week, but today’s print should be a wakeup call for the Biden administration. As inflationary pressures grow and Russia continues waging war on Ukraine, the president must act to ease the pocketbook pain Americans are feeling."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Inflation has now reached nearly 8%, another 40-year high. Gasoline prices were up 6.6% just last month, and 38% in the last year! The national average is now $4.32 per gallon, and in many places, prices are still rising."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Child sexual abuse is unconscionable. Sadly, there are some who seek to cover it up to protect themselves and their institutions.  and I want answers as to why the Department of Education isn't properly following the law to protect students. "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Putin must come to the conclusion that his invasion was a huge mistake, or it won't end in Ukraine. But he’s not the only audience here. Xi Jinping, as he watches this play out, must also decide that this is going very badly, and China shouldn’t follow a similar model. "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,An easy way to prevent China from buying Russian oil is to impose secondary sanctions on ALL Russian banks. There are no major international banks that will decide they'd rather do business with Russia than the U.S.  That's how you isolate the Russian economy. 
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Ending U.S. purchases of Russian oil and gas is just a start. We also need to put an end to the rest of the world funding Putin’s war machine. That means secondary sanctions on Russia’s banks, which would force the world to choose between doing business with Russia or the U.S. "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Rather than relying on hostile nations,  must reverse his disastrous policies to unleash U.S. energy dominance. He could start by reopening the Keystone pipeline, expediting natural gas infrastructure construction, &amp; repealing restrictions on U.S. oil &amp; gas production."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Energy prices in America are rising, &amp; the Biden Administration's first response is to run to brutal dictators with offers to ease sanctions in exchange for ramping up its oil production?This is absurd."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,I also implore NATO countries to donate Soviet-made fighter jets to Ukraine. The White House should act now so Ukraine receives the jets they need for self-defense.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,The U.S. must impose both an import ban on Russian energy and secondary sanctions to force other countries to do the same.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Just got off the call with President Zelensky. He continues to demonstrate bold, courageous leadership of the Ukrainian people."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"It’s about time.The longer we wait to cut off Russian oil and gas, the longer we’re helping fund Putin’s war.I hope the administration will not only halt U.S. purchases of Russian energy, but will also impose secondary sanctions to force other countries to do the same "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"In order to destroy Russia’s revenue stream and throttle its ability to continue waging war, the U.S. must cut off Russia’s ability to sell oil and gas."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Make no mistake: by failing to cut off Russian oil and gas, the U.S. is helping fund Putin's war.The U.S. must immediately halt its purchases of Russian energy and force other countries to do the same."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,Time is not the friend of the  people right now. We need to make Putin regret his unprovoked aggression by separating the Russian economy from the rest of the world. Foreign banks must be forced to make a choice: work with Russia or work with America. 
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Putin needs to regret his unprovoked war as soon as possible. 's &amp; my  Act will both choke off Russia's energy sector, which finances their brutality, and also force foreign banks to make a choice: do business with Russia or do business with America. Not both. "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Tonight was an opportunity for the president to turn a new page towards the unity he promised our country when he first took office, but unfortunately, Americans got more of the same."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"The president then went on to rehash a mostly partisan, liberal wish list, including the tax-and-spend agenda that recently failed in Congress."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"President Biden began his speech tonight with a good message about Ukraine. I hope that his actions match his rhetoric and he will impose the comprehensive sanctions against Russia that I, and my Republican colleagues, have urged."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,My deepest condolences are with  and her entire family as they go through this difficult time. My thoughts are with you all.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,I implore  to immediately impose sweeping secondary sanctions against Russia’s entire financial sector and for Congress to pass the Never Yielding Europe's Territory Act to impose such sanctions—before more blood is shed.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"While coordinating with our European allies is important, we can no longer wait on reaching a consensus with the EU before taking swift and severe action. America must step up and lead before Russian aggression escalates even further."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"As our sanctions regime against Iran illustrates, the world will choose the U.S. This would then entirely isolate Russian banks from the global economy—not just the U.S. economy—and shut down Russian oil and gas sales."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"It’s a start, but too many Russian banks are not effectively sanctioned. Secondary sanctions would force the world to decide between doing business with Russia or the U.S. by blocking from our economy any foreign bank that chooses to continue doing business with Russia."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,Who would have thought the Europeans would be the ones leading the way on imposing tougher sanctions on Russia? That’s exactly what happened over the weekend when they decided to limit Russia’s access to SWIFT.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Time is of the essence, which is why Sen. Schumer should schedule a vote on the Never Yielding Europe’s Territory Act this week, so we can finally do what we should have done months ago."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,We must immediately send more lethal aid to the Ukrainian people to help them as they fight for their lives.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Today, the European Union took great steps to authorize additional security assistance to Ukraine by announcing the purchase and delivery of weapons. As Europe ramps up its efforts to equip Ukrainians with the support they need, so must the United States."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Ukraine's leadership, security forces, and civilian population have demonstrated incredible resolve in their fierce fight to defend their sovereignty and livelihoods."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Serving in Congress should be a temporary honor, not a career. We are here to do the people's work and leave our nation stronger than we found it, not to provide ourselves job security. It's time to enact Congressional term limits."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"We can cut some Russian banks off from SWIFT. But to bring Russia’s economy to its knees, we must isolate *all* Russian banks from the global economy. That requires Iran-style secondary sanctions, which forces foreign banks to choose between doing business with the US or Russia. "
Toomey,SenToomey,right,The people of Oklahoma and the United States have been fortunate to have  serving them in Congress for over three decades. Jim is a true statesman and his leadership will be missed when he retires at the end of this Congress.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,Only the most qualified jurists who will diligently serve as neutral umpires of the law—not as unelected legislators with preferred policy outcomes—merit confirmation to serve as guardians of the Constitution and arbiters of our laws on the Supreme Court.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,I look forward to meeting with Ketanji Brown Jackson and thoroughly vetting her record to carefully consider her nomination to the nation’s highest court.
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"This includes supplying them with weapons, logistics support, and intelligence. Now is the time for the U.S. and our allies to send a strong message to the world: We stand with the Ukrainian people."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,"Meanwhile, it’s imperative that the U.S. step up its efforts to aid and equip Ukrainian freedom fighters."
Toomey,SenToomey,right,That’s why the U.S. should impose crippling sanctions on Russia’s oil and gas sector and Iran-style secondary sanctions on Russian banks that force the world to choose between doing business with Russia or the United States.

Reed,SenJackReed,left,The need for climate action is urgent. New study shows severe weather disasters cost the U.S. $750 billion over the past 5 years. It’s time to pass Biden’s comprehensive climate policy agenda to help create green jobs &amp; mitigate climate change.

Whitehouse,SenWhitehouse,left,The Judicial Crisis Network lurks at the center of a web of right-wing front groups built to control the Supreme Court and launch ugly smears against Biden nominees like Judge Jackson. It’s all an attempt to distract from their own dark-money operation.

Whitehouse,SenWhitehouse,left,"She arrived at her nomination through merit and ability, not via a dark-money turnstile controlled by right-wing donors seeking special influence."
Whitehouse,SenWhitehouse,left,"Today, I voted to advance a highly qualified and accomplished nominee to the Court. Judge Jackson possesses a keen legal mind, the ideal judicial temperament, and more courtroom experience than any of the sitting justices at their confirmations."
Whitehouse,SenWhitehouse,left,"Right wing dark money doesn’t just pick and plant and instruct the Republican Supreme Court justices, it drums up the Republican objections to Democratic nominees! "

Whitehouse,SenWhitehouse,left,The Republican majority on the Supreme Court has delivered over 80 5-4 partisan wins for big corporate &amp; partisan donors. The American people see those decisions and understand that the Court is rigged – that it’s now The Court That Dark Money Built.

Whitehouse,SenWhitehouse,left,I hope it’s smoother sailing. 
Whitehouse,SenWhitehouse,left,The Week is asking the right question! 
Whitehouse,SenWhitehouse,left,"If Republicans had any honest concerns about dark money, they’d support my DISCLOSE ACT to put an end to it. But they won’t – Mitch McConnell knows dark money is too important to his right-wing donors."
Whitehouse,SenWhitehouse,left,We have this oil cartel &amp; a small group of big oil companies that are setting prices &amp; reaping unbelievable profits. What are they doing with those profits? They’re passing the gains to shareholders – none of it is going back to consumers.

Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"We live in an America today where your ideology is held against you if you're a conservative. When you're a liberal, we're supposed to embrace everything about you and not ask hard questions. That's not the world we're going to live in. "

Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"After a thorough review of Judge Jackson's record and information gained at the hearing from an evasive witness, I now know why Judge Jackson was the favorite of the Radical Left."
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"However, her record is overwhelming in its lack of a steady judicial philosophy and a tendency to achieve outcomes in spite of what the law requires or common sense would dictate."
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"I find Judge Jackson to be a person of exceptionally good character, respected by her peers, and someone who has worked hard to achieve her current position."
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"My decision is based upon her record of judicial activism, flawed sentencing methodology regarding child pornography cases, and a belief that Judge Jackson will not be deterred by the plain meaning of the law when it comes to liberal causes."

Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"▶️It takes off the table one of the most effective tools we have had to deter illegal immigration and help bring order to the chaos at the border.▶️If you believe there is still a threat from COVID, it would be a complete disaster."
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"If it is true that the Biden Administration is talking about repealing Title 42 authority to deport illegal immigrants due to COVID, it would be a nightmare on multiple levels. ▶️It sends a signal encouraging even more illegal immigration, putting the problem on steroids."
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,Just when you think we’ve reached the bottom on bad ideas from the Biden Administration….it appears they will now go even lower. 
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"When it comes a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, this is the least the White House, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and nominee can do for the process."

Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,A month into this fight for freedom – where the Ukrainian people are fighting like tigers – President Biden has yet to embrace victory for Ukraine and has no coherent strategy to bring that about. He is always playing catch-up and explaining what he will not do.
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"President Biden’s press conference entered into the land of the surreal. President Biden again stated that he never believed sanctions would deter Putin – contrary to what he was telling Congress, the American people, and the world."
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"As Ukraine burns, President Biden is talking about Charlottesville and domestic politics. Very sad."
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,This lack of clarity by the President to Putin is making this conflict worse and incentivizes escalation in my view.
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,Does it mean that we are going to use chemical weapons against Russia if they use them? Or does it mean that we will consider that a provocation that would require a NATO no-fly zone over Ukraine?
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,As to the President’s response regarding Russia’s use of chemical weapons: I have no idea what an in-kind response means.
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,There is so much more that we should be doing:▶️ Give Ukraine all of the anti-ship missiles that they need.▶️ Provide them with a more sophisticated anti-aircraft capability.▶️ Urge our NATO partners to stop buying any oil and gas from Russia immediately.

Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"Ukraine has asked for the ability to defend its skies and for more lethal drones — and the world does not respond.  Why we do not provide more lethal drones, more advanced air defense systems, and support the transfer of MiG-29s is not only a mystery - it is shameful."
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,When it comes to supplying Ukraine with aircraft and advanced air defense systems:▶️ NATO is lacking.▶️ United States is somewhat AWOL. ▶️ Still no MiG-29s to bolster Ukraine’s air defense.

Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,The next step for me is to work with our British allies and hopefully others to create an intel cell that will make available to the public Russian military units engaged in war crimes and start naming their commanders. A name-and-shame campaign is in the making.
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,Very excited the U.S. Senate unanimously agreed to support the war crimes investigation being conducted against Putin &amp; his inner circle at the Hague. America should do all we can to aid this investigation by providing information &amp; intelligence to the court in a timely manner.
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,Very sad to hear my good friend  Jay Lucas will not be seeking reelection for the South Carolina House of Representatives. Jay did an incredible job as Speaker of the House and has much to be proud of. He created a model for others to follow.
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,The Attorney General has a bold and appropriate plan in these areas and I will do what I can to help to hold Putin and his regime accountable.
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,It is imperative Congress work with the Department of Justice in a timely manner to update our laws and create new authorities to go after the bad guys. We should provide additional funding to have a robust Rule of Law response to Putin.

Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,Learn more about the “Clemson 8” Challenge and the incredible story of Colonel Ben Skardon.Clemson 8 Challenge
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"On April 9, 1942, six Clemson alumni became POWs with tens of thousands of their brothers-in-arms when American troops fighting in the Philippines were ordered to surrender to the Japanese. This morning I attended the “Clemson 8” Challenge to honor these and other heroes. "
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,We must not let Putin determine the course of action we take to provide military assistance to the Ukrainians. The denial of MiGs is a major misstep in the effort to support Ukraine.
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"The decision to reverse course on sending the MiGs to Ukraine by the Biden Administration emboldens Putin, reduces the capability of Ukrainians to defend themselves and is a complete capitulation to threats made by Putin."
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"This decision, in coordination with other economic sanctions, should deliver a crippling blow to the Russian economy. Today’s decision regarding trading status is by no means an adequate substitute for providing Ukraine with MiG-29 fighter jets to defend their homeland."
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,Very much support President Biden and the G7 leaders’ decision to terminate Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status with Russia. This is another step in the right direction which should have been done earlier. 
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"The legislative process can be unseemly and ugly. However, with passage we funded the government and avoided a government shutdown. We also helped the U.S. military with an increase in spending as well as provided much-needed aid to Ukraine as they fight for their freedom. "
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,Speaking with   and  in just a few minutes.
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,We cannot let Putin run NATO or freeze our ability to respond appropriately. ▶️ The Ukrainian President asked for the jets. ▶️ Poland and other nations are willing to supply jets. ▶️ The Biden Administration/America fiddles while Ukraine burns. Send the jets!
Graham,LindseyGrahamSC,center,"The Biden Administration apparently supported Poland, a NATO member, transferring the jets, but all of a sudden it is untenable when America is involved in the transfer."

Scott,SenatorTimScott,right,Charter schools are vital to the future of America’s students. We must protect parents’ right to school choice and give their kids the opportunity to succeed. 
Scott,SenatorTimScott,right,"For years now, I’ve tried to make lynching a federal hate crime — today, the president will sign my anti-lynching bill into law."
Scott,SenatorTimScott,right,"President Biden's $5.8 trillion budget proposal brings back progressive policies of his failed ""Build Back Better"" bill. This is not the time for more reckless government spending."
Scott,SenatorTimScott,right,"Americans know the truth — massive amounts of reckless government spending gave us an inflation crisis, and more reckless government spending won’t solve this."
Scott,SenatorTimScott,right,The average American household needs to find an extra $276 each month just to keep up with the Biden administration’s sky-high inflation.
Scott,SenatorTimScott,right,"Recently sat down with  CEO Brian Moynihan to discuss their work with mission driven financial institutions, including Optus Bank in Columbia, SC. "

Scott,SenatorTimScott,right,Since day 1 — this administration has blundered America’s energy security.
Scott,SenatorTimScott,right,Congress cannot fully evaluate legislation relating to Social Security &amp; Medicare without updated information on the financial status of these programs. I joined   &amp; others in asking Sec. Yellen for an update:

Scott,SenatorTimScott,right,"For a South Carolinian making the median income in this country, it takes six or seven hours of work just to afford a tank of gas. This is what failed leadership looks like — the American people deserve better from this administration. "
Scott,SenatorTimScott,right,There’s no question — what we’re seeing from Putin is evil and must be stopped.

I'm proud the  endorsed my bill to ensure these leaders receive the same benefits as other educators so they can continue investing in our nation's students!
Scott,SenatorTimScott,right,The Biden administration wants you to believe these sky-rocketing gas prices are Putin’s fault. They’re hoping Americans forget about the rising prices we saw all last year.
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,My statement on the upcoming Supreme Court nomination vote⤵️ 
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,🚨 The average price of diesel in South Dakota has hit an all-time high. 🚨$4.863 per gallon.
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"This requires Supreme Court justices to exercise judicial restraint while making decisions on issues we as Americans hold most dear: life, liberty and property."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"Ultimately, I believe it’s critical anyone serving on the Supreme Court is fair-minded, and will interpret the Constitution and statutes as written to uphold the rule of law."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"In the days ahead of her final confirmation vote, I will continue to examine her judicial record and qualifications as a judge, before announcing how I intend to vote on her nomination."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"I appreciated the opportunity to visit today with Judge Jackson, ’ nominee to the United States Supreme Court. I came into our meeting with an open mind and take seriously the Senate’s responsibility to provide ‘advice and consent’ on Judge Jackson’s lifetime nomination. "
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"South Dakota would not be what it is today without the countless women who are involved in agriculture. Thanks to the wives, mothers, grandmothers, daughters and sisters who work every day on farms and ranches across the state. "
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,My friend  and I enjoyed visiting with high school students from West Central who are in DC today. Have fun on your trip! 
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"South Dakota farmers and ranchers work hard every day to feed the world. On National Ag Day, we say thank you."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"Thanks again for your leadership here, Chuck. Looking forward to your response and to potentially partnering with you to get this across the finish line."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"Lastly, my read is that this bill excludes 5 of the 9 JBS plants, 2 of the 3 Cargill plants and 2 of the 6 Tyson plants. That’s 9/18 large packers that are currently excluded. Is there a plan to include the rest of the plants?"
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"Another concern is that no region's minimum can be more than ‘3 times higher than that of the lowest region's minimum.’ Texas is at approximately 10%. Iowa was recently over 50%. Does this language “cap” Iowa, in this case, at 30%?"
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"So the only latitude left up to the Secretary is a comment period where they could make that minimum higher than the previous 18-month average, but not lower. Is that correct?"
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"Does the formula create a “floor”? Does this proposal seek to set a floor, a minimum cash trade, per packing plant, set by each feeding region? That regional minimum, while left up to the Secretary, cannot be below the previous 18-month cash trade average. Is this correct?"
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"I’ve been reading through the compromise legislation you proposed w/ . I believe your legislation is a step in the right direction toward more cash trade, transparency &amp; competition but have a few questions/concerns I’d like addressed before I can support it."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"Hey  - I’ve appreciated your leadership on a number of efforts to reform the broken cattle market. It’s been great working with you on bills that would make a difference for consumers and our producers, like 50-14 and the Meat Packing Special Investigator Act."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"Rural communities have historically suffered the most from initiatives like the AIR Commission. SD vets are witnessing this first-hand with plans to close facilities in Hot Springs, Sturgis and Wagner.  and I are leading a letter to  fighting for rural vets. "
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"February inflation hit a forty-year high of 7.9%. The anti-energy policies of the Biden administration are causing SD families to pay record-high gas prices. And, the inflation increase from Putin’s war has not hit Americans’ pockets yet. "
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,Good luck to  and  as they play in  Championship today.   
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"Great to see a sign of SD on the National Mall! Dr. Ashley Podhradsky’s statue is featured at the Smithsonian as part of Women’s History Month. Dr. Podhradsky, VP for Research &amp; Economic Development at DSU, is one of 120 women recognized for her innovative work in STEM. Congrats! "
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,Vladimir Putin is the enemy. We cannot continue to fund his war efforts. The Biden administration needs to stop worshiping at the altar of climate change. We must do everything in our power to produce more American energy. I joined   to discuss the latest. 
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"As a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I’ll fight like hell to make sure veterans in South Dakota receive the care they’ve earned. I call upon all veterans organizations to help us defend these services in rural South Dakota."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,The VA MISSION Act was bad public policy then and it’s gotten no better with age. While the provisions of this BRAC will not be released publicly until March 14th – the threat has become clear to our local veterans.
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"The VA MISSION Act also included provisions to include this BRAC-style process, which we learned today will negatively impact much of rural SD."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"The concerns I warned against in 2018 when I voted against the VA MISSION Act have come to fruition. Veterans were told they could receive care in the community, and that’s proven not to be the case."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,Stop importing Russian oil. Produce more American energy.Putin’s crude is crud.
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,Voted today to block the Biden Administration's CMS vaccine mandate which would apply to most health care workers.
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,Oil from Russia accounts for 4% of total US consumption. We continue to line the pockets of Putin as he wages war on Ukraine. This has to stop!It’s time to ramp up American energy production and end the U.S. and European dependence on Putin’s energy. 
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,We stand with the people of Ukraine. 🇺🇦 
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"I’m deeply saddened to learn of the passing of 's husband, Richard Blum. Losing a spouse is painful and life altering. Thinking of my colleague and her family during this time."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"Just voted no on H.R. 3755, also known as the Abortion on Demand Until Birth Act. Enough said."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"Vladimir Putin is a cold, calculating killer. We must continue to support the people of Ukraine as they defend their country. I joined  with  to discuss the ongoing situation. "
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"I take very seriously the Senate’s responsibility to provide advice and consent on these lifetime appointments, and look forward to meeting with Ms. Jackson in-person during her thorough and rigorous confirmation process."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"As I examine Judge Jackson’s record, I will look to her qualifications as a judge, her temperament and her ability to interpret the law as written while exercising judicial restraint."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"The Supreme Court is the highest court in the nation and has superior jurisdiction over all federal and state courts. Therefore, it is critical to make certain this nominee is fair-minded, and will honor the original intent of the Constitution and the rule of law."
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"The bill is supported by , , ,  and SD Stockgrowers. It’s not often that you have all the cattle groups supportive of the same idea, which says a lot. I thank Sen. Tester for his leadership and am hopeful others will get behind this effort"
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,Consumers should feel confident that their beef is safe. Foreign beef should not jeopardize the high-quality beef produced by American ranchers.
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,Brazilian beef poses a threat to both American consumers and producers. I'm joining  on legislation that would suspend Brazilian beef imports to the United States until experts can conduct a systematic review of the commodity’s safety.
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,My statement on the Durham Investigation ⤵️ 
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,Great meeting today with students from Takini. Enjoy your time visiting Washington! 
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"Great meeting today with members of the SD National Guard Enlisted Association. Whether serving their communities at home or our nation overseas, National Guardsmen have always answered the call. We owe it to them to make sure they receive the pay and benefits they deserve. "
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"As the conditions in Ukraine intensify, it's important to send a strong message to Vladimir Putin that a Russian invasion will not be tolerated. If Putin decides to carry out this action, Russia will be in for an ""economic hell"" that will devastate their country. "
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,Our first Valentine’s Day apart. My forever Valentine. 
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,Great time visiting with folks yesterday at the Black Hills Stock Show! Stop by our booth if you’re looking for help with a federal agency or to let me know your thoughts.

Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,"Visited with leaders from the City of Box Elder, Douglas Schools and Ellsworth Air Force Base. The B-21 will be here soon and so will thousands of new people in the region. Lots of planning to be done and actions to be taken, but good to hear an update. "
Rounds,SenatorRounds,right,Spent some time yesterday with . Exciting to hear about the growth and planning that is happening in this community. The future is bright!

Thune,SenJohnThune,right,Summertime E15 is rightfully “in the menu of options” to lower gas prices. But it’s not going to do American drivers any good if E15 only stays on the menu and not in gas pumps. It’s time to leverage American agriculture.  🇺🇸🌽

Thune,SenJohnThune,right,One more time for the people at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue: Energy security is national security.
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,Had a good meeting with the South Dakota sheep growers this afternoon. They told me an interesting fact: The U.S. military is the biggest consumer of American wool — using around 20% of the U.S. wool clip to make uniforms for our troops. 
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"What an accomplishment. Congrats, , on a great game and season so far. We’ll be cheering for you in the . Go Jackets! "
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,America shouldn’t be giving a single penny to Russia to fund Putin’s unjustified war against Ukraine. Sanctions must be devastating to Putin’s cash flow to help end his aggression.
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"America stands with the Ukrainian people who are bravely fighting for their homeland against an enemy whose evil knows no bounds. Where Putin shows evil and desperation, President Zelenskyy shows strength."
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,Spoke to South Dakota school  administrators and students this afternoon about the federal Impact Aid Program and other issues important to South Dakota schools. 
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"It’s time to end mask mandates — on planes, in airports, &amp; on school playgrounds. Glad to support ’s effort to begin rolling back some of these federal mandates, but there’s more that needs to be done, including rescinding the admin’s illogical toddler mask mandate."

Thune,SenJohnThune,right,. says  is “in the menu of options” 🚩🚩🚩 In the menu of options? Allowing year-round  is an immediate step Biden can (and should) take to help lower gas prices for Americans. Rs and Ds agree &amp; have urged the WH to do so. What’s the hold-up? 
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,Senate Republicans are clear: We will reject any weak deal with Iran that doesn’t stop its nuclear/ballistic missile programs or its support for terrorism. Iran’s weekend missile attack in Iraq should be a wake-up call to the Biden admin. 
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"Restoring American energy security and  will require a true all-of-the-above approach, and the solution is under our feet—from American oil fields to cornfields. "
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"The bottom line: We need to get our supply chain moving again, &amp; South Dakota exporters need to be able to get their goods to market in a timely manner for a fair price. "
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"Exactly. Rising energy prices affect every American, regardless of party. Rs &amp; Ds agree: Ethanol can help.  and I led our colleagues in calling on Biden to make use of this bipartisan energy solution to lower gas prices and leverage American agriculture. "
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"New consumer inflation numbers paint a clear and stark picture: prices are skyrocketing, bills are climbing higher, and hardworking Americans are paying the price — literally — for Democrats’ failed policies. "
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"President Biden should take every step possible to curb rising domestic energy costs and displace banned Russian oil imports. A no-cost, immediate step he can take: Permitting the sale of E15 fuel this summer. A win/win to help lower gas prices &amp; support American ag."
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,. Biden is AWOL when it comes to prioritizing clean energy solutions like biofuels. We're in an energy crisis. Gas prices are skyrocketing. An American-grown solution should be on the table. American farmers and consumers are waiting.
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,Appreciated the opportunity to meet with folks from  this afternoon. It was a timely conversation as Americans face increasing concerns around energy security and affordability. 
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"Loved having my beautiful wife Kimberley in the office today on . She has been a shining example to our girls, myself, and countless others of what it means to be a kind, strong, and accomplished woman. Couldn’t have asked for a better partner in life. "

Thune,SenJohnThune,right,Reduce dependence on foreign energy.Stop prioritizing imports from countries run by bad actors.Invest in American energy.Achieve energy independence.
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"Big championship day in the Summit League tourney. At least one South Dakota team will walk away as a champion. Good luck to , , and , and congrats on a well-played season so far.   "

Thune,SenJohnThune,right,Congrats! Championship bound!  
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"Not Russian energy. Not Iranian energy. Not Venezuelan energy. Mr. President, why not try American energy?"
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"Russian leaders are living in an alternate universe, and they’re trying to convince the rest of the world to join them. Here in reality, the free world – and many everyday Russians – will not fall for their mangled truth. "
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,Caught up with Jeff Lamb (aka Chloe’s dad) to congratulate him on ⁦⁩ being named ⁦⁩ WBB POY. Tried to guard Jeff back in the day. Would rather watch Chloe play. Good luck to all SD teams playing in the tourney. We’re pulling for you. 🏀

Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"., don't turn your back on South Dakota veterans. Tell your  to reverse proposed reduction in services at several VA facilities in SD. Our veterans rely on these sites for life-saving care."
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,Had a great visit to the Silencer Central facility in Sioux Falls today – what an impressive South Dakota business. 
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,Disappointed &amp; frustrated by Biden’s  proposal to close VA facilities in the Black Hills. SD vets deserve respect &amp; top-notch care. I’ve fought tooth and nail to defend these important facilities &amp; will do everything in my power to push the admin to change course.
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,The crime surge that’s occurring across the country has hit South Dakota tribes hard. I had a productive meeting today w/ Oglala Sioux Tribe leadership about how to make tribal communities safer and stop the upward trend of violence and crime. 
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"Ways to lower energy prices:- Fast-track responsible oil/gas development- Authorize pipelines, like Keystone XL and for LNG- Leverage American biofuels- Slash gov’t red tape "
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"We need pipelines, not pipe dreams.Affordable electric vehicles are years away from being widely available enough to reduce dependence on liquid fuel.President Biden, bring back American energy dominance."
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"Just voted no on Sohn’s nomination in . Her clearly held biases have no place on the FCC, which must be a fair and independent body. "
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"Putin wants regime change. Well, the ruble has tanked, Russia’s economy is isolated, &amp; Putin is a global pariah. A growing number of Russians, even oligarchs, might also have regime change in mind."
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"This is awesome. Thanks to Myah and Tori for being difference makers, both on and off the court. "
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"While no detention slips were served, my Capitol office was temporarily turned into the ultimate principals’ office today. I appreciate everything these South Dakota school leaders do to help students get the top-notch education they deserve. "
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"Had productive ag meetings with SD members of , , &amp; South Dakota Agricultural and Rural Leadership this afternoon. As always, I value &amp; appreciate their insight &amp; feedback. "
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"The growing number of Russians protesting in the streets from Moscow to St Petersburg to Siberia are making clear Putin is losing the trust of everyday Russians – particularly of the younger generations, who will inherit a decimated economy. "
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,Joined  &amp;  to recap last night’s . One thing I wanted to hear more about: American energy. Biden has been 100% wrong in this area. We must reinvest in American-made energy so we never have to rely on foreign powers like Russia for fuel. 
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"Had the opportunity to catch up with South Dakotans from across the state. I met with the Braun family in town from SD, folks from , and Veterans from . Thanks to everyone who stopped by. "

Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"In these perilous times, I pray that God watches over the United States and our fellow citizens, especially the men and women who defend our country in uniform.My full statement on  ⬇️ "
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"When the president delivers his State of the Union address tonight, I hope he pivots away from the rank partisanship that has defined his first year in office and led to many of these self-inflicted crises. "
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"Despite the CDC relaxing mask guidance across most of the nation, the Biden admin is keeping its requirement that toddlers in Head Start programs wear masks – even on the playground. This has been ridiculous from the start, &amp; with CDC relaxing, it’s even more absurd."
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"Every dollar the world denies Putin by not buying his oil &amp; gas is one less dollar he has to spend attacking Ukraine.I've said it before, &amp; I'll say it again: Energy independence is a matter of national security. Biden must reverse course &amp; put American energy back in the game."
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,I wonder if the president will discuss the real state of our union tonight:-historic # of illegal border crossers-40yr record-high inflation-self-inflicted energy crisis-nation-wide crime surge-masking toddlers on the playgroundIt’s beyond time to turn things around.
Thune,SenJohnThune,right,"Inflation is at a 40-year high, there’s chaos at our southern border, &amp; Ukraine is under attack, yet  &amp; Washington Dems have decided to prioritize a bill that would virtually green light abortion on demand. Disgusting &amp; more time wasted on a far-left, radical agenda."

Alexander,SenAlexander,center,He was a great and loyal friend. Honey and I send our love and respect for Johnny’s life to Dianne and to all the Isaksons.

Alexander,SenAlexander,center,My statement on the presidential election. 
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"I like to suggest you look at Washington, D.C., as a split-screen television. On the one side, you see the confirmation hearings and the tweets. On the other side, you see Democrats and Republicans working together to create a vaccine and getting results for the American people. "
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"Each of us should be grateful to the scientists in pharmaceutical companies and the federal government who produced this result, both the Trump Administration for leading it and Congress for funding it."
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,Producing a 95 percent effective vaccine in 8 months instead of the 8 years it often takes is truly a medical miracle.

Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"And, finally, please tell them that I wake up every day thinking I may be able to do something good for our country and that I go to bed most nights thinking that I have. Please tell them that it has been a great privilege to be a United States Senator."
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"Remind them that most of the rest of the world wishes they had our remarkable system of government and that the US Senate has been, and I hope continues to be, the institution that does more than any other to create broad agreements to solve great problems and unify our country."
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"And most of our politics is about disappointments in not reaching the high goals that we have set for ourselves, such as all men are created equal."
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"As the political scientist Samuel Huntington wrote, most of our arguments are about conflicts among principles with which most Americans agree."
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"That we are not perfect, but, as our Constitution says, we are always working to form a more perfect union."

Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"Invariably one teacher will ask, “Senator, what would you like us to tell our students about being a United States senator?”"
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,My favorite time as a senator has been inviting onto the Senate floor American history teachers who are attending the academies that were established in legislation proposed in my maiden address.
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"Being a senator is more like bring a parade organizer. You pick the route, recruit the marchers, select the music and even pick someone else to be the drum major — and then you walk in the middle of the parade so the marchers don’t march into the ditch."
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"Being governor is like being Moses. To get something done, you say, “Let’s go this way.”"
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"Some former governors don’t like being a senator. Not me. The jobs are just different. In both jobs you pick an urgent need, develop a strategy and try to persuade at least half the people you are right."
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"Why join the Grand Ole Opry if you don’t want to sing? And I guarantee you that if 15 or 20 Republicans and 15 or 20 Democrats in this talented body set out to change that practice, it would change."
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"And the behavior that needs to change first is for individual senators to stop blocking amendments of other senators. If you are opposed to something, you ought to vote no. Why stop the entire body from considering the amendment?"
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,You don’t have to eliminate the filibuster to restore the Senate to its traditional role of working across party lines to solve big problems. We don’t need a change of rules. The Senate needs a change of behavior.
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"But it’s hard to accomplish something if you don’t vote on amendments. Lately, the Senate has been like joining the Grand Ole Opry and not being allowed to sing."
Alexander,SenAlexander,center,"It doesn’t take a genius to figure out how to gum up the works of a body of one hundred that operates mainly by unanimous consent. Here’s my view: It’s hard to get here, hard to stay here, and while you’re here, you ought to try to accomplish something good for the country."

Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Both Disney and their supporters in the Chinese Communist Party support taking away rights from parents.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Since Title 42 is being terminated because COVID is over, why do we need to spend another $10 billion on COVID relief or wear masks on airplanes?"
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Hunter Biden exploited his family name, and Joe Biden and Ron Klain are trying to keep it “low low key.” "
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Here’s what you need to know about Biden Inc. —The Biden family has done 5 deals in China totaling some $31M —Hunter Biden’s assistant was allegedly a Chinese researcher —Hunter’s private equity firm held a stake in a company with ties to the highest levels of the CCP
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,The Biden administration is throwing Americans’ security aside in the name of optics. Abandoning Title 42 will lead to unprecedented chaos at our southern border. 
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Why is no one surprised that a problematic CNN anchor is angry that someone who is pro-free speech will have more say on what happens at Twitter. 
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Elon Musk has made clear he opposes big tech censorship, and that’s something all freedom-loving Americans can get behind."
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Communist China is rapidly expanding its nuclear weapons and military capabilities while Biden is advocating to reduce our nuclear weapons.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,The hypocrisy coming out of the Biden Administration just doesn’t end. Their latest stunt? Ending Title 42 because COVID is over while continuing to force Americans to wear masks on airplanes.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Hunter profited off of Joe Biden’s office with money from CCP linked businesses.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Joe Biden’s chief of staff thinks it’s okay for Hunter to take money from Communist China while exploiting his father’s office. 
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Judge Jackson will be a rubber stamp for the radical left. 
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"The left wants to rewrite our history, allow children to choose their gender, and teach CRT."
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Judge Jackson’s record has made it clear that she will interpret the Constitution through the lens of progressive ideology. I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of her nomination to the Supreme Court. 
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,A Supreme Court justice’s primary commitment should always be to the Constitution — not to woke progressivism.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"In the time since Judge Jackson testified at her confirmation hearing, Disney has eliminated saying “boys and girls,” the State Department announced you could select “X” as a gender on your passport, and TSA will implement gender-neutral security screenings."
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"The radical left is teaching five-year-olds that they can choose their own sex. Meanwhile, they’ve put forward a nominee to the Supreme Court who cannot define the word “woman.”"
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,The heinous war crimes Putin is carrying out against innocent Ukrainian civilians are monstrous and despicable. The USA unequivocally stands with Ukraine in its fight to preserve its sovereignty.

Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,We’ve had unprecedented numbers of illegal immigrants pouring across the southern border. Biden has done nothing.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,We can’t sit back and allow the left to indoctrinate our children.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"President Biden’s budget will force cuts to key nuclear capabilities, at a time when Russia is threatening nuclear war.

Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Now is not the time to roll back restrictions on illegal immigration.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Parents across America are paying attention to what their children are learning in the classroom, and they’re speaking up. Ban critical race theory."
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,It is absolutely paramount that we secure our southern border.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Disney won’t say “boys and girls,” and schools are teaching children critical race theory. The left has launched a full-blown assault on American values. "

Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Stopped in to see Mayor Jeff Tibbals in Scott County, where we discussed the importance of ensuring residents have access to broadband and telehealth. "
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Biden’s new Iran Nuclear Deal is filled with loopholes that let known terrorists enter and stay in the U.S.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Met with local leaders in Morgan County and heard from them about how decisions in Washington are affecting them — including unprecedented illegal immigration, inflation, and reckless spending. "

Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,The pandemic is over for illegals crossing our border but not Americans being forced to wear a mask on airplanes. 
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"In Anderson County, I spoke with Chamber officials concerned with high prices at the pump and Biden’s bandaid fix to release 180 million barrels of oil. We must prioritize finishing the Keystone pipeline and making America energy independent again. "

I spoke with local officials, including Sevier County Mayor Waters, Fire Chief Puckett, Pigeon Forge Mayor Wear, Police Chief Catlett, Fire Chief Watson, and City Manager Teaster."

Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Liberal activists are forcing themselves between parents and their kids, stripping words and institutions of their meaning and indoctrinating our culture with whatever fits their agenda. "
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Parents will not allow our children to be indoctrinated.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Biden administration policies, not Putin, have caused record-high gas prices."
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,The  adding an ‘X’ gender option on U.S. passports is another example of the Biden administration bending to the far left’s agenda.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Hillary Clinton’s campaign has been fined by the FEC for their corrupt and dishonest funding of the Steele dossier that smeared President Trump.Good. Let’s make sure the deep state never gets away with something like this ever again.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,The only reason Hunter isn’t being investigated is because of his last name.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,My team and I are monitoring the situation in Sevier County and praying for all those impacted. Thank you to all of our first responders working around the clock. Please continue to follow guidance from local officials in the area. 
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Disney should focus more on entertaining children and less on indoctrinating them with the left’s woke agenda.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,95% of poll participants in my tele-town hall last night agree that a Supreme Court Justice must understand the biological difference between a man and a woman. Thank you to the Middle and East Tennesseans who joined. 
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,We have reached a point in society where five-year-olds are being taught they can choose their gender.

Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Joe Biden’s tax hike will not benefit you; it will only benefit the left and their radical agenda.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,The left is actively erasing the definition of a woman before your eyes.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"This is happening right now on your southern border, and Joe Biden is busy advocating for a radical climate agenda. "
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Under the Biden administration’s new rule, more illegal immigrants will be allowed to enter our country under the false guise of asylum. "
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Tennesseans deserve to know who Judge Jackson is and what she believes. 
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Thank you to our veterans who served so selflessly during the Vietnam War. Today and every day, we honor your bravery and sacrifice. "
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,The federal government never gets enough of the tax payers money. 
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,This goes beyond a single definition — it’s about the left’s culture war on women and our family values.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Biden’s economic plan will put families out of work.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,The Biden economic agenda is the surest way to ship your jobs overseas.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Joe Biden’s historic nominee to the Supreme Court can’t even define what a woman is.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Right on, ! "
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Biden told the Polish president, “We have on our southern border thousands of people a day, literally not figuratively, trying to get into the U.S.""There is simple is a solution to that problem, . "
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Americans are suffering under record-high inflation.

Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"The liberal media is beyond triggered that Judge Jackson, nominated on the basis of her sex, could not even define the word “woman.” CNN and their cronies are exasperated and can't cope with the facts. CC: , , , , "
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,Anyone who exploits our children is a predator and deserves to be locked up.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,We need a Supreme Court Justice who will adhere to the text of our Constitution – not invent rights to serve their political interests.
Blackburn,MarshaBlackburn,right,"Democrats want gasoline ‘stimulus’ checks. Let’s deal with the root cause instead. It’s time for the U.S. to restart the Keystone pipeline, drill domestically, and become a net exporter of oil and gas."

Warner,MarkWarner,left,"We got my cyber reporting legislation done just as intelligence has started to suggest that Putin is considering additional cyberattacks. This was a critical accomplishment, but more support is needed."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,The images we've seen out of Ukraine are horrific and it's clear additional repercussions against Russia are needed. I applaud the Biden admin for taking this step in concert with our allies.
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"I’ve enjoyed learning more about Judge Jackson’s qualifications during her hearing: public high school grad, clerked on every level of federal courts, endorsed by many orgs like the Fraternal Order of Police, more judicial experience than 4 current justices combined and more."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"The ACA changed millions of lives, and it’s helping more people than ever. Hear from some of them in this video: "
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"I’m worried about how gas prices are affecting Virginians, so I’m advocating for an “all of the above” approach to solving this issue: supporting American energy independence, investigating price gouging, increasing drilling through unused leases, and investing in clean energy."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"We lost a legend in Madeleine Albright – she was an incredibly accomplished diplomat, a trailblazer for women everywhere, and a tireless advocate for human rights. Her contributions to global diplomacy will outlive her."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Our spending bill contained all sorts of smart investments – like supporting the Head Start program, raising the maximum Pell Grant award, increasing funding for a program that helps families afford child care, and so much more. We’re investing in Virginia children and families. "
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"There is evolving intelligence that the Russian government is exploring options for more intense cyber attacks. I commend  for trusting our intelligence community, amplifying these concerns, and calling on the government and private industry to bolster their cyber defenses."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"I just introduced a bill alongside  that would designate 92,449 acres of the George Washington National Forest as National Scenic Area. This would protect water sources that serve more than 4 million Virginians, boost the tourism industry, and protect at-risk species."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"On this day 12 years ago, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. This law saves lives. It protects those with preexisting conditions. And it saves millions of Americans money every year."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"On the anniversary of the deadly shooting in Boulder last year, I’m thinking of all the lives touched by gun violence this year, including those in Norfolk this past weekend. Thoughts and prayers are not enough."

Warner,MarkWarner,left,Our intel community has been incredibly helpful and accurate throughout Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – and now they are warning that Russia may soon unleash more aggressive cyber attacks. I’m taking these threats seriously and pushing for more safeguarding measures.
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Today, I spoke alongside  and  about the progress we’ve made towards getting our China competition bill done. We have bipartisan and White House support, so I’m hoping we’ll get this law done soon and bring manufacturing jobs back to America. "
Warner,MarkWarner,left,Very humbled by this column. I’ll keep reminding people that Ukrainian people are losing their lives over the basic freedoms we get to enjoy in America – and I’ll keep doing what I can to support them.
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"I enjoyed hearing about the qualifications of Judge Jackson yesterday, and I look forward to hearing more today through further questions. I take my responsibility to vote on her confirmation with the larger Senate very seriously."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,Glad to see the Senate move forward on the America COMPETES Act last night – I’ve worked hard to secure provisions that would bring manufacturing back to the United States to make us more competitive and lower prices for all. It’s time to get this done.
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Bringing American jobs back home. Easing the supply chain and fighting inflation by manufacturing critical semiconductors. Promoting American competition. These are bipartisan, commonsense priorities, and we can make good on them by getting my CHIPS bill done."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"As Russian attacks escalate, we must also think about escalating our military aid to Ukraine. I support extending more resources in concert with our NATO allies."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"No matter what sport, Virginia teams are always winning! Congratulations to  and  on their championship victories this weekend."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Now more than ever, I’m glad we passed cyber reporting legislation a few weeks ago. With increasing reports that Russia might deploy more cyber weapons soon, it’s critical we got this law done, and I’ll keep fighting for laws that protect Americans from cyberattacks."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,I’ve long pushed for more transparency about climate risks – it’s good for the climate and it’s good for the business community. I look forward to reviewing this new proposed regulation in greater depth.
Warner,MarkWarner,left,The most important factor in deciding how best to support veterans is listening to real feedback from vets. I’m committed to doing that as the VA works towards modernizing its services.
Warner,MarkWarner,left,One thought on diversity of experience on SCOTUS:There have been 0 justices ever with experience as a public defender.There are 3 justices on the court currently that worked with the Bush campaign on Bush v. Gore.
Warner,MarkWarner,left,A good read from The Daily Progress. I’m thinking every single day about the plight of the Ukrainian people and the ways Congress and the global community can step up to stand in opposition to Russia.
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Homeownership is one of the best ways to build wealth, so I was extremely frustrated to hear reports that Wells Fargo has denied a higher percentage of refinancing requests from Black and Latino homeowners. We must investigate this and ensure equal opportunity in housing."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,Rooting for the  tonight! 
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Gun violence is a tragic epidemic. Thinking of the victims of last night’s shooting in Norfolk, and their families."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,I’m thinking of those affected by the violence in Ukraine every day. Every life lost in this senseless invasion is a tragedy. I’m doing what I can to help the US and global community respond and protect Ukrainians.
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Inflation is hurting families, and I’m focused on proposing real solutions. That’s why I’m urging Congress &amp; the White House to get my CHIPS bill signed into law as soon as possible – it would ease the supply chain, lower costs, and bring manufacturing jobs back to America."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,Russia’s attacks are barbaric. It’s time to take the next step and start sanctioning all complicit in this invasion – including military officers and members of the Russian parliament.
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Putin is isolated and power-hungry. His attacks frequently target civilians. He is a war criminal, and the U.S. should keep sending military aid to Ukraine so they can defend themselves against these brutal attacks."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,Some victories for animals in VA and abroad this week: I announced $1 million for the expansion of a veterinary college in Lee County and secured a more thorough investigation into mistreatment of American bomb-sniffing dogs abroad.
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"We need to make sure Russia isn’t using crypto to evade sanctions – that’s why I’ve introduced a law to close loopholes and make sure our sanctions keep working. We’re making a real impact on the Russian economy, but we have to keep pushing."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Alongside , I secured $85 million for VA-specific projects in our recent spending bill: money for local VA community colleges, counties, police departments, wells, senior centers, bridges, parks, and more."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,It’s unconscionable that there are still vestiges of discrimination in our housing system. I’m joining ’s call for an investigation into Wells Fargo so Black and Latino homeowners aren’t stuck paying higher interest rates for decades. 
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Glad to be on this bill with , , and  – it’s time to make sure our sanctions are actually airtight. "
Warner,MarkWarner,left,Happy  and best of luck to all our Virginia teams! My picks for the men’s and women’s tournaments: 
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"America often sends highly trained bomb-sniffing dogs abroad to support our allies – but too often they die of preventable causes because they’re not receiving attentive care. That’s not ok, so I secured a provision in a recent law to get to the bottom of this issue."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Gas prices matter to me – and that’s why I’ve called for a further look into price gouging, because oil prices are back down but Americans aren’t seeing it at the pump. "
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Russia’s aggression is creating chaos in the global economy and affecting prices for all Americans. In my role as the Chair of Senate Intel, I hosted an open hearing last week with leaders in the intel community so all Americans are briefed on updates. "
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Russia has tremendous capacity to wreak havoc through cyber attacks on Ukraine or even directly on the United States. I’m frankly surprised we haven’t seen more from them in this sphere, and I’m fighting for stronger cyber defense policy for the US."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"I lost my mom to Alzheimer’s, so I know the challenges of this terrible disease firsthand. I was glad to support a provision last week that will increase federal funding for Alzheimer’s research to $3.5 billion total – a tremendous investment in treating and curing this disease."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Especially after today’s address from Zelenskyy, I commend this decision. It’s time to get Ukraine more tools as they deal with Russia’s unprovoked attacks."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Broadband is a top priority for me – and after investments from the American Rescue Plan, bipartisan infrastructure law, and most recent omnibus, we’re closer than ever to achieving universal, affordable internet access in Virginia."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,I was moved by the remarks of President Zelenskyy this morning. Virginia stands with Ukraine as they navigate the terror of this senseless invasion.
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Veterans won big with the omnibus law we passed last week: $13.2 billion for mental health, $2.2 billion for homelessness, $2.4 billion for telehealth, and $97.5 billion for the VA. We’re getting our veterans the resources and services they deserve."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,A heartbreaking loss for the Covington community – I’m thinking of the family of Officer Caleb Ogilvie and those impacted by this tragic act of violence.
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Glad to see  issue recommendations to modernize health care for veterans following my advocacy, and I look forward to hearing more feedback from our veterans in Virginia. "
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Congress got it done last week: passing postal reform, reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, securing $85 million for specific Virginia projects, and more. Next up: filling our SCOTUS vacancy."
Warner,MarkWarner,left,Glad to see several Virginia-based businesses pull out of Russia and donate to humanitarian aid in Ukraine. We have unity in Congress and among businesses that we must economically isolate Russia – Virginians stand with Ukraine. 
Warner,MarkWarner,left,A woman needs to work this far into the year to make what a man made in 2021 – and the problem is even worse for Black and Latina women. We need equal pay for equal work – it’s critical to closing the racial wealth gap and ending child poverty. 
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Sorry Jon – I just don’t see MSU making it past some of our great VA teams that made the tournament, like , , , and ! "
Warner,MarkWarner,left,"Last week’s omnibus was an incredible win: it contained provisions to support small business, advance access to financial institutions in underserved communities, fight climate change on military bases, and more."
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"Playing politics with a virus is a path to more deaths. If we are to continue our progress in defeating this virus, we need funding to support testing, therapeutics, and vaccinations, NOW. We cannot wait for the next wave or a new variant. We need to be prepared now."
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"There is still time to pass the needed funding for vaccines, testing, therapeutics, treatments, and diagnostics to address the ongoing needs of the  pandemic before the two-week Easter break. Republicans should stop blocking this bill and let the Senate do its work."
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"We need to fund testing, therapeutics, &amp; vaccinations, NOW. We cannot wait for the next wave or a new variant. I strongly support this agreement, and I will work to obtain funding to stop the virus from spreading and mutating overseas, and attacking Americans here at home."
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,This is not the bill I would have written. The lack of any funding to support a global vaccination campaign is shortsighted &amp; dangerous. A virus does not recognize our borders. But that is the result of a bipartisan negotiation. The Senate should have advanced this bill today.
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"Republicans blocked a bipartisan COVID package that would have provided more vaccines, tests, &amp; treatments to Americans. They would rather hold this bill hostage to secure votes on partisan, unrelated policy matters than make Americans more safe from the next COVID surge/variant."
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,My statement here: 
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"16 years ago the UN Gen. Assembly designated April 4 as the Int’l Day for Mine Awareness.  With the Russians using landmines to terrorize, maim and kill Ukrainian civilians, we must redouble our efforts to pressure all nations, including the U.S., to ban these insidious weapons."

Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"I enjoyed visiting with Dr. Lydia Clemmons in the Barn House in Charlotte this weekend, which houses art her parents brought back from trips to Central and Western Africa. Proud to have secured funds to help preserve the farm’s rich history. "

Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"I strongly encourage President Biden to see this through. In the face of atrocities &amp; tyranny, the world should see that America is a refuge for the oppressed &amp; persecuted. Welcoming refugees is not just something we do--it is who we are. "
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"This photo of them sleeping was published in TIME Magazine with a profile of Secretary Albright. Later while they were kidding around and exchanging hats, the man watching them skeptically from behind was President Clinton."

Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"Marcelle and I are so saddened to learn of the loss of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. I’ve known, worked with and admired Madeleine Albright for decades.

Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,Welcome home to the  soldiers returning from Kosovo today. Job well done! 
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"I ended my Qs asking Judge Jackson what kind of  Justice she would be, if confirmed. Her response deeply inspired me; I will never forget it. And I know it will inspire millions of Americans. She is EXACTLY the kind of nominee Americans want &amp; need on our highest court: "
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"During my 2nd round of Qs to Judge Jackson, I asked her why it's so important for our democracy's institutions to reflect the diversity of our nation. She replied that diversity in our courts strengthens public confidence in our democracy &amp; the rule of law. I couldn't agree more: "
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,I was proud to cast my vote for this bill. 
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"Whatever else happens to be going on in Washington in any year, I try to keep up my long tradition of visiting and photographing, however briefly, the glorious cherry blossoms that surround the Tidal Basin. Marcelle and I took these. "
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"We also discussed her record as a proven consensus builder. In the courts, as well as the Senate, we simply get better results when we seek to find common ground. This is exactly the approach that Judge Jackson would bring to , in the mold of her mentor, Justice Breyer. "
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"During my questions to Judge Jackson today we discussed her support from those all across the political spectrum. That support is rooted in her unimpeachable track record as an even-handed, unbiased judge. Regardless of party, Senators should acknowledge her impeccable record. "
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"""Sen. Leahy noted that the last Supreme Court nominee with any significant experience as a defense attorney was none other than Thurgood Marshall."" "
Leahy,SenatorLeahy,left,"And a good Day One it was.

Sanders,SenSanders,left,"The organizing victory at Amazon on Staten Island is a signal that American workers will no longer accept exploitation. They're tired of working longer hours for lower wages. They want an economy that works for all, not just Jeff Bezos. Congratulations to ."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"According to a new Gallup poll, 112 million (44%) Americans are struggling to pay for healthcare, and more than double that number (93%) feel that what they do pay is not worth the cost. Yes. It's time for a health care new system. It's time for Medicare for All."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,Anybody who thinks we do not have an oligarchy right here in America is sorely mistaken. The question before us is whether we will stand with the billionaires and big money interests or will we stand with the working families of this country and protect their interests. 
Sanders,SenSanders,left,LIVE: The Senate Budget Committee is holding a hearing to discuss how President Biden's budget proposal responds to the major crises facing our nation. 
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Now that the President has submitted his budget plan, it is up to Congress to review it, pass the proposals that make sense and improve upon it. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Nurses are the backbone of our health care system. Yet, today, nurses are overworked and underpaid – and there aren't enough of them. I am working on legislation to address this crisis."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,When we talk about oligarchy in America we are talking about 700 billionaires who became nearly $2 trillion richer during the pandemic &amp; pay a lower tax rate than a nurse while the child poverty rate soared by 41% in January because the expanded Child Tax Credit ended.
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Residents should not have to work 80 hours each week in a hospital. It was an honor to meet with residents at UVM Medical Center who are organizing a union in order to provide not only decent wages and working conditions, but to improve care for their patients. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"The American people are sick and tired of being ripped-off by corporations making record profits, while working families pay absurd prices for gas, rent and food. The time has come for Congress to work for working families and demand that big corporations pay their fair share. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"It makes zero sense to provide $53 billion in corporate welfare to the microchip industry and give $10 billion to Jeff Bezos so he can go to the moon. I know it is a radical concept, but maybe the government might want to work for working class Americans, not the billionaires. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"It is imperative that Senators be allowed to vote on whether we should give Jeff Bezos a $10 billion handout to go to the moon and give, with no strings attached, $53 billion to massively profitable microchip companies. I'm going to do all I can to make sure those votes happen."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Micro-chip companies shut down their plants in the United States and hired cheap labor abroad. Now, the same companies who sold out the American worker, are in line to get $53 billion in corporate welfare. Does that make any sense to you? "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,We have never seen this level of corporate greed in America. Let’s go through a few examples. 
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"At a time of unprecedented greed, the Senate is right now debating giving $53 billion to the highly profitable micro-chip industry and a $10 billion bailout to Jeff Bezos so that he can launch a rocket ship to the moon. I'm LIVE on the floor to oppose it. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"I say to Howard Schultz: This is a pivotal moment for Starbucks. As you return to the company, it is time to do the right thing: End the union busting and obey the law. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,I’ll be LIVE on the floor of the Senate floor today at 2:30pm ET to oppose a bill that hands $53 billion to profitable microchip companies. The people of this country are sick and tired of corporate greed. We must stand with them.
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Why does Putin fear Alexei Navalny? Because Navalny exposed Putin’s enormous corruption, and the unimaginable wealth Putin has stolen from the Russian people. That’s why Putin is trying to discredit and silence him. Release Navalny now!"
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"""Medical debt"" and ""Medical bankruptcy"" are two phrases that should not exist in the United States of America. Removing 70% of past-due medical debt from credit reports is a step in the right direction, and much more needs to be done. We must cancel all medical debt. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Corporate greed is Amazon increasing its profits by 75% last year to a record $35 billion, denying workers a $3 raise, illegally underpaying drivers and blaming a $20 price hike in a Prime membership on ""inflation"" while Jeff Bezos became $81 billion richer during the pandemic."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"In the midst of the current set of horrors – war, oligarchy, pandemics, inflation, climate change, etc. – we must continue the fight to establish health care as a human right, not a privilege. I will soon be reintroducing our Medicare for All legislation."

Sanders,SenSanders,left,Corporate greed is Moderna giving its CEO a $923 million golden parachute &amp; handing out $360 million in stock options to 2 top executives after receiving $2.5 billion from U.S. taxpayers to develop its COVID vaccine &amp; refusing to share it with the world. We must end this greed.
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Here is the untold story of the global economy. Oligarchy reigns and is getting worse. Today, the 10 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 3.1 billion. We need progressive global taxation and an economy that works for all, not a tiny handful of multi-billionaires."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"LIVE: I’m joining two strong progressive voices,  and , to discuss the international progressive response to Russia’s war on Ukraine."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Wendy's increased its net income by 70%, pays its CEO 532X more than its median worker &amp; is spending $100 million on stock buybacks. Now it's blaming the rising price of a Frosty on inflation? No. The problem isn't the Wendy's worker who got a 50 cent raise. It's corporate greed."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,Big oil companies are engaged in massive profiteering and price gouging. We need a windfall profits tax. March 2008Gas: $3.23 per gallonOil: $104.54 per barrel March 2014Gas: $3.51Oil: $102.28 Last week:Gas: $4.10Oil: $111.42 Today:Gas: $4.32Oil: $95.17
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"If Jeff Bezos can afford a $500 million yacht, a $23 million mansion with 25 bathrooms and a rocket ship to blast a comedian to outer space, you know what? Amazon can afford to give its employees a $3 raise. I stand in strong solidarity with the Amazon workers walkout."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"The war in Ukraine is an absolute disaster for the people of Ukraine and the entire world. But with or without a war, we cannot lose focus on the crises facing working families in the U.S. today. Congress can and must walk and chew bubble gum at the same time. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,Why is the price of oil LOWER today than it was in 2014 while the average price for a gallon of gas nationwide is 80 cents a gallon HIGHER than it was eight years ago? Answer: Corporate greed. Now is no time for profiteering. Now is the time for a windfall profits tax.
Sanders,SenSanders,left,We must achieve economic justice in this country — that means equal pay for equal work NOW.
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at a TV channel in Russia, interrupted a live broadcast with a sign that read “NO WAR. Stop the war. Don't believe the propaganda. They're lying to you here.” She has since been detained. This is an act of incredible courage. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"If we can spend $782 billion on the military industrial complex and handout $52 billion in corporate welfare to the profitable micro-chip industry, please do not tell me we cannot afford Medicare for All during a pandemic or the Green New Deal during a climate emergency."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Barack Obama was right. A gas tax holiday was a bad idea in 2008 and it's a bad idea today. If we're serious about providing consumers relief at the gas pump, let's take on the greed of big oil by enacting a windfall profits tax and ending OPEC's illegal price-fixing cartel. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,If there's a lesson that should be learned now it is that moving quickly to renewable energy is not just an environmental issue. It is a matter of national security. We must deny Putin and other petro-dictators the ability to hold the global economy hostage. The time is now!
Sanders,SenSanders,left,I’m delighted to see an agreement reached so that the MLB season can start. But we must prevent the greed of baseball’s oligarchs from destroying the game. The best way to do that is to end MLB’s antitrust exemption and I will be introducing legislation to do just that. 
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Last year, oil &amp; gas companies made $174 billion in profits. This year they're on track to make more. We cannot allow big oil to use Ukraine &amp; ""inflation"" as an excuse to rip-off Americans. I'm proud to join  to introduce a windfall profits tax. Let's get it done."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"This is oligarchy. This is greed. This is callousness. Last year, over 2 million people worldwide died of hunger. At the same time, the world’s 2,755 billionaires saw their wealth go up by $5 trillion – from $8.6 trillion to $13.8 trillion. This is why we need a tax on wealth."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"If there's one thing to learn from this horrible crisis it's this: We must end our dependence on big oil &amp; authoritarian regimes for expensive fossil fuels that are destroying the planet &amp; harming our economy. Now, more than ever, we need a Manhattan Project for renewable energy."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Today the Senate passed the Postal Service Reform Act. Is this all that is needed to fix the problems of the Postal Service? No, it is not. But it's an important step forward for one of our nation’s most important government agencies, for its workers, and for our communities. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,Oil company revenues since last year:Exxon: ⬆️ 57%Chevron: ⬆️ 84%Shell: ⬆️ 49%BP: ⬆️ 45%We cannot allow big oil companies to continue to take advantage of the war in Ukraine &amp; inflation to make huge profits by jacking up gas prices. We need a windfall profits tax.
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Super-large yachts have become the status symbol of the billionaire class. And Russian oligarchs are not the only people who own them. While half of our people work paycheck to paycheck, members of the American oligarchy spend hundreds of millions to build their very own yachts."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Oligarchy and massive wealth inequality exists not just in Russia. It's worldwide. Since the pandemic, while the wealth of the world's 10 richest people DOUBLED, the income of 99% of the world’s population declined. The result: More yachts for the rich. More hunger for the poor."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"The GOP claims to be the party of the working class. Yet, the head of the GOP campaign arm released a plan to raise taxes on half of Americans while imposing massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and education. Oh, yeah. They sure LOVE working people. No doubt."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,This is what Oligarchy and Authoritarianism is all about. Putin is not only destroying Ukraine and the Russian economy. He is now in the process of ending the last vestiges of Russian democracy and free speech.
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Unfortunately, we have a corrupt political system and some Senators are more interested in getting campaign contributions from the wealthy and the powerful than doing the work of the American people. It’s a sad state of affairs. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"We talk about being a divided nation. In many ways, that’s true. But, in some ways, we are absolutely united. For example, we all hate the drug companies. "

Sanders,SenSanders,left,Putin and his oligarch friends have stolen from the Russian people. They have it all while ordinary people are suffering. I have so much respect for the incredibly brave people in Russia who are out on the streets protesting against what their president is doing. 
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Starbucks could give every one of its 383,000 workers a $5,000 bonus &amp; still keep $2.6 billion in profits from last year. Instead they're raising prices while spending $20 billion on stock buybacks &amp; dividends when profits are up 31%. Don't blame inflation. Blame corporate greed."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,Abortion is a constitutional right.
Sanders,SenSanders,left,Corporate greed is Amazon blaming a 17% increase in its prime membership fees on labor costs while its profits soared 56% last year to $33 billion &amp; Jeff Bezos became $74 billion richer during the pandemic. The problem is not the Amazon worker making $15 an hour. It's greed.
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"We can no longer allow big oil companies, huge corporations and the billionaire class to use the murderous Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing pandemic as an excuse to price gouge consumers. It is time to enact a windfall profits tax and reasonable price controls."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"This Russian father is right. Putin and his oligarchs started this horrific war but, as is always the case, it's not their kids who will fight it. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"We need a new member of the Supreme Court who has a strong track record standing up for justice – economic justice, racial justice, social justice, political justice and environmental justice. There is no doubt that Judge Jackson is that person. I strongly support her nomination. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Putin and his oligarch friends seek a divided world and the destruction of democracy. We must stand with the Ukrainian people against this war, and with the Russian people who are demonstrating against their corrupt, reckless president who started it. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"In an authoritarian country like Russia, protest is an act of enormous courage. I stand with the Ukrainian people against this war, and with the Russian people demonstrating against their corrupt, reckless president who started it."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"The U.S. and our allies must impose severe sanctions on Vladimir Putin and his fellow oligarchs. At a time when thousands may die as a result of his war, Putin, one of the richest people in the world, should not be allowed to enjoy the billions he stole from the Russian people. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"It is outrageous, if unsurprising, that Trump would praise Putin’s murderous invasion of Ukraine as an act of “genius.” It should concern us all that Putin is exactly the kind of leader Trump would like to be, and that so few Republicans have the courage to say this out loud."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Corporate greed is Tyson Foods raising the price of beef by 35% while its owner became $1.6 billion richer during the pandemic, its profits skyrocketed by 140% last quarter to $1.12 billion and its CEO got a 22% raise last year to $14 million. It’s not inflation. It's greed."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,Future generations will ask us what we did to stop the climate crisis. What will we tell them?
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Vladimir Putin’s latest invasion of Ukraine is an indefensible violation of international law, regardless of whatever false pretext he offers. There has always been a diplomatic solution to this situation. Tragically, Putin appears intent on rejecting it. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Yes, it's important that McDonald's pigs be treated humanely. But maybe it's more important that we take care of the humans who work there by paying them a living wage and making it easier to form a union, instead of spending $15 billion on stock buybacks to enrich the wealthy. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"I know it is a radical idea, but maybe we should do what the American people want, and not what wealthy campaign contributors want. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,Today in America:- the two richest people own more wealth than the bottom 40%- the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 92% That level of inequality is immoral and unsustainable.
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"If we do not have the courage to stand up to the wealthy and powerful, future generations will look back at this Congress and say, “Where were you?”"
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"In the midst of our cold winters, one of the outdoor pleasures for many Vermonters is ice fishing. Recently, my team went out on the ice to hear from some Vermonters about why they love the sport. I hope you'll enjoy hearing what they had to say. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"It is outrageous that a drug discovered with American taxpayer dollars costs nearly $190,000. This is just one more example of the incredible greed of the pharmaceutical industry. I urge the Administration to use the tools they have to lower the cost of this drug now. "
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"It is beyond belief that in 2022, as we face challenges like covid &amp; climate change, any national leader would start a war that could kill thousands &amp; create millions of refugees. There is a diplomatic solution to this crisis. It is tragic that Putin seems intent to reject it."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,Never before in American history have so few owned so much. Maybe the Senate should consider a resolution congratulating the billionaire class for their enormous success transforming our society. 
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"In January, the child poverty rate increased by 40% in just 1 month – jumping from 12.1% to 17% as 3.7 million children slipped into poverty. How did this happen? 50 Republicans and 1 corporate Democrat allowed the $300 a month Child Tax Credit to expire. That is morally obscene."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"When we talk about power in America, we must talk about the handful of Wall Street firms that wield enormous influence over millions of workers, consumers, and our entire economy — from banking and transportation, to newspapers, nursing homes, hospitals, and emergency rooms.

Sanders,SenSanders,left,"I’ll be LIVE today on the floor of the U.S. Senate at 1:40pm ET. At a time when the working class is falling further behind and the billionaire class is doing incredibly well, it is time for Congress to stand up for working people."
Sanders,SenSanders,left,"Shock. Shock. Shock. Gas prices are at the highest level in 7 years while Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell &amp; BP made nearly $25 billion in profits last quarter – the highest level in over 7 years.

Murray,PattyMurray,left,"Let’s lower child care costs for working parents. Let’s offer parents more options. Let’s help businesses fill vacancies. Let’s work towards an economy that actually works for working families. Let’s do it now, because our families, and our country, can't afford to keep waiting."
Murray,PattyMurray,left,So my message today is that when it comes to child care—one of the big budget items most working families have to navigate—the status quo isn’t working for the millions of parents who need child care and the providers who need to recruit and retain talented educators.
Murray,PattyMurray,left,"Democrats have put forward bold solutions on child care. We have a fully paid for plan to bring down costs for families, bring up wages for workers, &amp; give parents more freedom to choose the quality child care options that are right for them—&amp; more quality, free pre-k options."
Murray,PattyMurray,left,"The reality is that when parents can’t work because of child care, that’s not just a problem for them—it’s one more position a small business can’t fill, it’s one less link in our supply chain moving things along, and ultimately it’s one more strain on our economy as a whole."
Murray,PattyMurray,left,"But then, COVID-19 hit.The pandemic decimated the child care system—causing an estimated 1 out of 10 providers to close doors, &amp; a third of workers to be laid off or furloughed. And it would’ve been far worse if Democrats didn’t provide support in the American Rescue Plan."
Murray,PattyMurray,left,"Child care workers, who are most often women, &amp; overwhelmingly women of color, earn, on average, $10.72 an hour, &amp; rarely get benefits they need—like health care, paid leave, or retirement benefits. This makes it hard to retain high quality child care workers."
Murray,PattyMurray,left,"Before the pandemic, half of all Americans lived in a child care desert. Nationally, there are 5+ infants &amp; toddlers for every 1 opening, &amp; in rural areas, there are 9 kids for every 1 opening.And finding child care is even more challenging for parents of kids w/ disabilities."
Murray,PattyMurray,left,"In my state, child care costs more than college tuition, &amp; nationally 4 out of 10 parents have gone into debt due to the cost of child care, &amp; almost 3 in 10 have had to choose between paying for child care or paying rent. But the scope of the problem goes well beyond just cost."
Murray,PattyMurray,left,"When it comes to child care, things are not working for families at all—and they haven’t been for some time. I'm chairing a Senate HELP Committee hearing about cutting the costs of child care and preschool for working families. "
Baldwin,SenatorBaldwin,left,We are poised to write an important chapter of progress in our nation’s history. It's going to happen and I am standing on the right side of that history supporting the confirmation of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the United States Supreme Court. 
Baldwin,SenatorBaldwin,left,"Now  is taking action to build on this progress which would mean 200,000 uninsured people would gain coverage and nearly 1 million Americans would see their coverage become more affordable. "
Baldwin,SenatorBaldwin,left,"Thanks to the American Rescue Plan,  premiums are at an all-time low, while enrollment is at an all-time high. 4 out of 5 Americans can find quality coverage for under $10 a month, and families are saving an average of $2,400 on their annual premiums."

Baldwin,SenatorBaldwin,left,"These Senate workers were on the job during a pandemic and violent insurrection. Their hard work should be rewarded with pay, better economic security, and layoffs should not be on the table. I stand with them &amp; the Senate should as well."

Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Biden stopped building the wall &amp; dismantled all the programs that were reducing illegal immigration – except for Title 42. The result was 1.25M illegal immigrants in 2021. Now he is ending the Title 42 restriction and the border will be completely open.

Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Our children have lived in a state of fear for the past two years thanks to Anthony Fauci and his miserable failure of a response to COVID-19. I fully intend to hold Fauci and the COVID cartel accountable. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,The Democrat party and the mainstream media have divided our nation and are not being held accountable for their lies. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,“Is this a great country or what?”Love these words that are part of the mission statement for AmeriLux in DePere. This manufacturer leads with optimism and a belief that in America anything is possible. Great hearing from workers there today.

Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"I don’t see how anybody could call our response to COVID-19 a success. The human toll, the economic devastation, the delayed learning of our children.We need to do oversight on this miserable failure and make sure it never happens again. "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Only if you weren’t looking for it. Aren’t you supposed to be an investigative journalist? And yet you thought the Steele dossier was true but the Hunter laptop was Russian disinformation?When will the advocates in the media apologize for what they’ve done to America? 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Biden laid out his number one goal and that was to unify and heal this nation. He’s done the exact opposite. Every action he’s taken has only divided and weakened America. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Tonight’s teletownhall will now take place at 4:45pm CT. I look forward to speaking with Wisconsinites and answering constituent questions.Be sure to listen live:

Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"7.9% inflation didn’t just happen. Democrats' war on fossil fuels and out of control deficit spending caused it. Inflation is the Democrat tax increase and a real gut punch to all Americans.It’s wiping out wage gains, making life more difficult, and weakening America."
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Yesterday I heard from members of the People’s Convoy.The truckers represent all the heroes of this pandemic. They are fighting against these idiotic and pointless mandates and want their freedoms back. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,The Biden administration’s policies have weakened America and emboldened our enemies since day one. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,The pandemic isn’t what caused this emergency with children. The COVID Cartel’s failed response did and their allies in the mainstream media are covering up for them. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Biden admin won’t rule out buying oil from Venezuela.Apparently everything is on the table except increasing domestic energy production? Biden's war on fossil fuels is causing gas prices to soar and sacrificing America's energy independence.

Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Our federal health agencies are so arrogantly non-transparent. They are arrogant to the American public. They are not providing the information people need to make tough decisions to get through this pandemic. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Biden's response to Russia was a miserable failure. A successful response would have deterred Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine and prioritized American production of fossil fuel. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,The 's arrogant refusal to provide COVID-19 data to the public shows how this Administration has favored censorship over transparency. How much longer will the  hide the data used to justify its reckless policies?
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"The  relied on a flawed study to justify masking kids in school.In private, the CDC has acknowledged the errors. Americans deserve transparency in government. Instead, agencies have not been honest and arrogantly refused to be transparent."
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,So much of the State of the Union was dishonest.  is unwilling to acknowledge reality and address the problems his administration and Democrat policies created. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Looking forward to joining  and  tonight on  to discuss Biden’s SOTU and his policy failures that have weakened America. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Today’s the day. Join me at 4:35pm CT tonight to ask questions about the most important issues facing our state.
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,". you were the one that divided us by scapegoating the unvaccinated for your COVID-19 failures and imposing your pointless, destructive, and divisive mandates. Now you want others to ignore your failures and divisiveness and simply move on. "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"President Biden seems oblivious to the harm his administration and policies have caused Americans. Unfortunately, the State of the Union is not good, and it will not improve with President Biden and Democrats in total control of the federal government. "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"I met with Wisconsin energy leaders in Washington, DC today to discuss the importance of securing our electrical grid and supporting U.S. energy independence. It's great to talk with Wisconsinites about real solutions to the challenges facing our state. "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Remember to sign up for this week’s telephone town hall. Excited to answer questions from constituents and hear what’s on your mind.  
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Ukraine wishes you would have sat 2017-2020 out when you appeared over 467 times for over 57 total hours lying bold faced to America and the world about Russian collusion evidence you never had.You helped weaken and make Ukraine vulnerable. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Under this administration there’s a war on fossil fuels. What happened to our bipartisan goal of energy independence? These reckless Democrat policies are weakening America and the West. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Pray for President Zelensky. Pray for the Ukranian people who just want to live in peace and freedom.There’s only one group of people responsible for these atrocities – that’s Putin and his cronies. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Have you not read the Michael Sussmann indictment that shows Russian disinformation was paid for by the Clinton campaign and pushed by corrupt media outlets and advocates like you? 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"I have no idea why anyone would believe much less follow  guidelines at this point. It will take years to restore their credibility. Tragic, but not as tragic as the needless loss of life from lack of early treatment.My oped with Dr. Malone —&gt;  "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"Wisconsin will always welcome an American President, but with open borders, rising crime, 7.5% inflation, $30 trillion debt, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, should  be making a campaign stop? Here’s Exhibit A of this admin’s incompetence. Will  be the Ukraine czar? "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"There is only one group of people responsible for the tragedies unfolding – Putin and his cronies. Europe must act with strength and resolve to prevent risking a wider conflict, and the U.S. must support our NATO allies and freedom loving people in this moment of extreme peril. "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"Across the board, the Biden administration and Democrat policies have weakened America and that emboldens our enemies. "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Biden now wants to blame Putin for energy prices rising when it’s his administration and Democrat policies that are the cause. That’s what’s costing American consumers dearly. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Why did it take 2 years for the legacy media to report this? Our federal health agencies have shown contempt for the American public by ignoring my oversight letters.  It’s well past time for transparency and accountability.
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"For America and the world to be safe, America must be strong. Everything that President Biden has done since taking office has weakened America. "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"Tom Marazzo, you ARE a hero. All your fellow peaceful protesters are heroes. This tyranny must end. God Bless you all."
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,They will never admit they were wrong. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Sadly? What’s so sad about a milder form of virus that provides immunity against more serious disease? Only sad if you’re part of the Covid Cartel wanting to profit off the pandemic.

Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"I heard concerns from the Green Bay legal community they needed a judge who is locally based and actively involved there.Further, I cannot support someone for a lifetime appointment that has granted low bail for someone charged with violent felonies."

Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"Honored to meet , a courageous freedom fighter. "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"Former Defense Sec. Bob Gates was right, Biden has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy issue over the past four decades and his record is just continuing. "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"The Democrats have created an economy with too many dollars, chasing too few goods. Which is why we have 7.5% inflation and a 40 year high. This is a direct result of Democrat governance. "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,The mainstream media are co-conspirators in this political dirty trick. Will they be held accountable for their role in this deception? 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Don’t forget to sign up to join my telephone town hall call list. Excited to talk with Wisconsinites and answer questions from constituents at 4:15pm CT tomorrow.

Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,The mainstream media are co-conspirators in covering up this scandal and need to be held accountable. The American people deserve the truth. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,I believe top officials in FBI and “sister” intel agencies pushed the Russia hoax as a diversionary operation to cover-up their complicity in Clinton campaign crimes. Hard to overstate the damage done to America because of their wrongdoing. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"People should be asking Tammy Baldwin and the Biden admin why they’re trying to tank the contract between Oshkosh Corp and USPS. They had no problem canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline. That cost 2,000 WI jobs. Why isn’t the press asking that? "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Thank you to the thousands of Wisconsinites who joined last week’s telephone town hall. Join me again at 4:15pm CT this Wednesday to talk about important issues facing our state.  
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Here’s a simple solution to the Canadian trucker strike. End the pointless and idiotic vaccine mandates. Respect everyone’s freedom and personal health autonomy.

Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"Democrats may not want to hear from parents about their children’s education, but I certainly do. Great meeting with parent leaders in southeastern Wisconsin looking to make a difference in their children’s schools. "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,Thank you  for the warm welcome to your school! One of the best parts of my job is meeting with young people and hearing what’s on their mind. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,This reaction is all you need to know about what the COVID gods’ decisions have done to our children. We want to see our children joyful.We want to see our children’s smiles. 
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"COVID had an impact on our psyche because you and the COVID gods created a state of fear and blocked early treatment. Over 900,000 people have died. They didn't all have to, that's on you, COVID gods. "
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"New bulletin states if DHS thinks you post “misleading narratives and conspiracy theories,"" or ""mis-dis- and mal-information” on topics like COVID-19 you will be labeled a domestic terrorist.Will I be next? Will you? This should frighten every American."
Johnson,SenRonJohnson,right,"It pains me to see this article and the confirmation of what, I, for many months have been warning hospital systems, federal health agencies, and the public at large about. These mandates are as destructive and divisive as this article proves. "

Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,Republicans have been demanding the administration take the shackles off American energy producers since President Biden took office. That starts with holding new lease sales on federal lands &amp; waters and issuing drilling permits. We have the energy at home &amp; we must use it.
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,. is finally doing what members of Congress have been pushing for all along. His decision to ban Russian oil is a much-needed step to kill Putin’s cash cow. We should not replace Russian oil with oil from dictators in Iran and Venezuela.

Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right, These orders are going to increase the costs for American families to heat and power their homes. And they are going to undermine the reliability of our electric grid. 
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,.’s new pipeline policies will damage America’s energy supply and damage our ability to help our allies. These policies are going to make it next to impossible to build any new natural gas infrastructure or upgrade our existing facilities in the United States. 
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,Biden’s anti-American energy policies have been a jackpot for Putin to enable him to fund his killing machine. We cannot address this crisis if we do not address energy. We’re stronger as a nation if we’re selling energy to our friends &amp; not having to buy it from our enemies. 
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"Will join  today at 2 pm to talk about how Senate Republicans are leading the charge to cut off Putin's energy cash cow, produce more American energy, and help our European allies escape Russia's energy trap. Tune in to . "

Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"Tonight, Americans heard more of the same failed ideas and tired liberal talking points. They deserve better. I’ll continue to stand up for families in Wyoming, and fight against Biden’s radical, dangerous, failed policies. "
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"Time after time,  has shown that he is asleep at the switch. He should have started by ending his war on American energy that would help Americans dealing with skyrocketing costs, and help our allies escape their dependence on Russian energy."
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"President Biden’s  comes as America is in crisis. From inflation, to crime, to the wide-open border, Biden offered little in the way of credible solutions.  is quick to blame everyone else for the problems his policies have created. Tonight’s speech was no exception. "
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"With the establishment of  150 years ago, Congress set the gold standard for National Parks.  "
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"Inflation is at a 40-year high, gas prices are at a seven-year high, the border is open, crime is rampant in the streets and  is going back to the playbook he used his entire life and the American people are not buying it. "
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,Our national security is increased by reducing the potential leverage Russia holds over our allies. The USA has abundant natural gas supplies. It is time for Congress to provide our NATO allies &amp; defense treaty partners a better energy option and pass the  now.
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"Today, Senate Democrats blocked an opportunity to stand up to Putin, help our European allies, and strengthen America’s energy security. They said no to a bill that our European allies have asked for to help them escape Russia’s energy trap.  "
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,Putin's economy &amp; war machine is funded by Russian energy.  has done everything he can possibly do to undermine American energy security. He approved  &amp; asked Putin to produce more energy &amp; sell it to America. It’s as if Putin were ' secretary of energy.

Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,I strongly condemn the ruthless and unprovoked attacks by Russia against the people of Ukraine. The United States and our allies must hold Putin accountable and respond with the most aggressive and devastating sanctions possible.
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"Apparently, the foreign policy of the Biden Admin is: Better late than never. After failing to apply sanctions and forcing Democrats to vote against them, Biden is finally doing the right thing. Putin’s  pipeline should have been sanctioned a long time ago. "
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"The day after Russia invaded Ukraine,  has released a critical minerals list that makes the U.S. more vulnerable to Russia &amp; our adversaries. We have abundant supplies of uranium &amp; helium.  should make producing them in America a top priority. "
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"President Biden must respond with crippling sanctions on Russia immediately. The world is watching – especially China. If Putin gets away with this, it will embolden China to move against Taiwan."
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"There isn’t time for weakness or indecision. Putin is illegally trying to take over parts of Eastern Ukraine and ordering Russian troops to roll in. Putin is a predator who wants to put together the old Soviet Union. If he’s not stopped, it won’t end with Ukraine."
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,America can help loosen Putin’s economic and political grip on the region. Biden must lift the burdensome restrictions on producing and exporting abundant American energy. We should pass my ESCAPE Act that will expedite American natural gas exports to our allies.
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,Germany finally took a step in the right direction on the  pipeline. Putin must not believe this is a momentary pause but an end to the pipeline. It is past time for the U.S. and Europe to quickly impose sanctions on Putin’s pipeline.

Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"The Biden admin continues to defy the courts &amp; the law. The BLM has blown past a critical deadline required to hold the first federal onshore oil &amp; gas lease sale this year. As a result, Wyoming &amp; other states will now miss oil and gas lease sales for the fifth quarter in a row. "
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,There is a solution to the high cost of American energy: produce more American energy.We have the resources here in America. We have the individuals wanting to work and produce American energy. We need an administration that will allow us to do so. 
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"Putin doesn’t respect statements, he only respects strength. He views President Biden as weak and ineffective especially after the way we exited Afghanistan. If Putin is able to invade Ukraine easily, it’s a concern that other countries like China will be able to do the same. "
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"This President has been at war with American energy since day 1 and he continues to dance to the tune of the climate elitists. Whether it’s with executive orders or legislation, Biden wants to keep American energy in the ground and as a result we are paying much more for energy. "
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"The best way to deter Russia from invading Ukraine is to impose biting sanctions now, not after an invasion. Since  refuses to take immediate action, Senate Republicans have stepped up with a bill that will make Putin think twice. "
Barrasso,SenJohnBarrasso,right,"Joe Biden is the president of high prices. Inflation will be a defining failure of this president’s administration to the point that in just one year as president, Joe Biden has driven inflation to a 40 year high. "

Enzi,SenatorEnzi,right,"I especially owe thanks to my wife Diana. It has been a long journey since I first told her I was thinking of running for Mayor of Gillette 50 years ago. She has supported me more than anyone can truly comprehend. In no uncertain terms, I couldn’t have done it without her. "
Enzi,SenatorEnzi,right,"If my experience over the years has taught me anything, it is that we will never be able to tackle these challenges unless we find common areas of agreement first and work to solve those problems together."
Enzi,SenatorEnzi,right,"As we move forward, our country has no shortage of problems we need to address. Some are out of our control, but many are of our own making."
